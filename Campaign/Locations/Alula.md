# Alula – Treetop Stronghold of Fanewick

## Overview / Description

- **Type:** Wildborne treetop settlement & rebel stronghold  
- **Function:** Sanctuary, trade hub, lore center, and de facto “capital” for parts of the Fanewraith rebellion in central Fanewick.  
- **Location:** High in the ancient canopy of [[Fanewick]]’s central forests, near [[Eldergrove]] / [[Tree Spire]], connected by hidden paths to [[The Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds]] and indirectly to [[Serpents Hope]] via river routes and smugglers’ trails.

- **Physical Layout:**  
  Alula is a vertical labyrinth woven into and between colossal trees:
  - **Upper Canopy (Sun-Lofts):**  
    Sun-drenched platforms, lore halls, and shrines. Home to:
    - Loreborne scholars.
    - Elder Council chambers.
    - Small gardens and observatories.
  - **Mid-Level Platforms (Heartwalk):**  
    Market decks, common housing, workshops, and taverns.
    - Rope bridges connect “neighborhood trees”.
    - Trade stalls for herbs, night blooms, river goods.
  - **Lower Platforms & Undercanopy (Shadowreach):**  
    Shadowed walkways near the forest floor:
    - Refugee quarters.
    - Smuggler dens (e.g. Sump Lantern).
    - Rebel staging areas and Fanewraith’s Shadow Council influence.
    - Entry to the **Thorngrowth Spire** zone – a twisted treant corpse and Witherwild scar beneath Alula.

- **Corruption & The Thorngrowth Spire:**
  - Beneath Alula, a once-guardian tree was twisted in the **Thorngrowth Incident**, becoming the **[[Thorngrowth Spire]]**:
    - A massive thorn-ridden trunk that pulses faintly with Witherwild energy.
    - Vines regrow each [[Nightveil]], assaulting lower platforms if not constantly pruned.
  - Witherwild influence manifests as:
    - Thorny vines creeping along lower walkways.
    - Mutated birds nesting in warped branches.
    - Sporadic bioluminescent fungi in the undercanopy, glowing uneasily at night.

- **Atmosphere:**  
  - By day (Sunnar): bustling markets, birdsong, creaking wood, rope bridges swaying.
  - By Nightveil: bloom-lantern light drifting through fog, whispered prayers, hunters and rebels moving in the dark, predators and Withered beasts calling from below.

- **Population:**  
  ~250 permanent residents, swelling with refugees and travelers.

## Recent and Mid-Term History

### Mid-Term History (Last 50–100 years)

- **Founding:**
  - Founded centuries ago by Wildborne and Ridgeborne [[Wicklings]] fleeing ancient wars.
  - Built as a **neutral treetop refuge** above the worst swamp plagues and ground conflicts.

- **Loreborne Hub:**
  - Became a center for **Loreborne** scholars studying:
    - Faint Divinities.
    - The Witherwild’s long, cyclical behavior.
    - Ancient routes through Fanewick.
  - Neutral ground: [[Communities/Wanderborne]] caravans brought goods from Haven, other bog-towns, and inland communities.

- **Pre-Invasion Role:**
  - Alula thrived on:
    - Trade in herbs, night blooms, rare fungi.
    - Mediation between forest clans.
    - Tribute to gods like [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]] and [[Rohkin, the Wandering Horn]].

### Recent History (Last 1–5 years)

- **Haven Invasion & Plague:**
  - Haven’s push into Fanewick and the Serpents Sickness crisis changed everything:
    - Alula tried to remain neutral but increasingly became a **haven for refugees** fleeing farms, labs, and patrols.
    - Witherwild surges intensified after Nikta’s Eye was stolen and Bolgin fell.

- **The Thorngrowth Incident (6 months ago):**
  - During Nightveil, a petrified treant guardian beneath Alula “awoke” in a corrupted state:
    - Thorny vines exploded outward, collapsing bridges and platforms.
    - 20 villagers (mostly youth and elders) were killed or dragged into the depths.
  - The treant’s corpse became the **Thorngrowth Spire**.
  - Result:
    - Deep trauma and grief in the community.
    - Heightened fear of Witherwild.
    - A generation of youth radicalized—perfect soil for Fanewraith’s influence.

- **Fanewraith’s Ascendancy:**
  - In the wake of Thorngrowth and Haven raids, **Fanewraith** rose as a rebel icon.
  - Alula became:
    - A key base of operations.
    - A symbol of “the wilds striking back.”
  - Her agents (especially slyborne and wildborne) embedded themselves in the undercanopy.

- **After the Siege of Serpents Hope (Timeline Tie-In):**
  - News arrives that:
    - Serpents Hope’s farms were attacked by coordinated Withered forces.
    - A **Leshen Warden** rose and was slain.
    - Haven shipments of Lady’s Veil are wounded but not dead.
  - In Alula, this is read as:
    - A partial victory.
    - Proof that Witherwild can be wielded—but also that Haven can still adapt.
  - Refugees and rumors from the farms bring:
    - Stories of a **Stone Serpent knight** fighting to save Wicklings (Sabriel).
    - Whispers of **betrayals and executions** being planned to show that traitors within Fanewick will not be tolerated.

## Population and Demographics

- **Total:** ~250 permanent residents; + variable refugees.

- **Ancestries:**
  - ~40% Elves/Fauns – agile climbers; many Loreborne, rangers, traders.
  - ~30% Fungril/Firbolgs – fungal and plant-tied folk, often herbalists, growers, or shamans.
  - ~20% Humans/Halflings – traders, refugees, mixed-background families.
  - ~10% Others – drakona scouts, ribbet runaways, slyborne with unclear roots.

- **Age Profile:**
  - Elders: Lorekeepers and spiritual guides.
  - Adults: Hunters, traders, sap-tappers, guardians, rebel operatives.
  - Youth: Torn between tradition and rebellion; some drawn to Fanewraith; others fearful of more violence.

- **Classes & Occupations:**
  - Dominant: [[Classes/Ranger]], [[Classes/Druid]], witches, Loreborne scholars.
  - Slyborne rogues and smugglers in the lower levels.
  - A few former Haven soldiers or orderborne in exile (Sabriel-like figures), living discreetly.
  - No formal wizards; arcane practice is more witchcraft, hedge rites, divinity bargaining.

---

## Hierarchy & Governance

- **Elder Council (Open Power):**
  - 5-member council, mostly Loreborne and respected elders.
  - Leads by consensus; decisions influenced by omens and divination.
  - Seeks to:
    - Keep Alula alive and reasonably safe.
    - Avoid total war with Haven.
    - Restrain Witherwild excess.
  - Key figure: **[[Elder Thorne]]** – Elf Loreborne, cautious, deeply scarred by Thorngrowth, wary of Fanewraith’s extremism.

- **Shadow Council (Hidden Power):**
  - Informal grouping of:
    - Fanewraith-aligned rebel leaders.
    - Slyborne fixers.
    - Sympathetic younger hunters.
  - Operates from the undercanopy:
    - Plans sabotage against Haven farms and supply lines.
    - Converts trauma and anger into militant action.
  - Was once loosely coordinated by **Fanewraith** directly; now more often commanded by a masked lieutenant…

- **The Masked Commander – Evelyn DeVoss**  

> [!NOTE] DM Only  
> Evelyn DeVoss is **Sabriel’s former commander**, a once-respected leader in the **Knights of the Stone Serpent**, presumed dead in the battle against [[Bolgin, Bringer of the Black Marsh]]. She now serves as one of Fanewraith’s top officers.  
> In Alula, she appears as the **“Face of Fanewraith”**, wearing a stylized mask and rarely revealing her name. Most believe she *is* Fanewraith or an avatar; in truth, Fanewraith is elsewhere, and Evelyn has been left in charge.

  - **Public Role:**
    - Known as “The Mask” or “The Wraith’s Hand.”
    - Commands rebel militias and Wither-touched operatives within Alula.
    - Imposes harsh “justice” on those deemed to have betrayed Fanewick or the wilds.
  - **Private Nature:**
    - Conflicted but zealous; believes Haven must be broken and the Sowing Eye restored to balance, no matter the cost.
    - Haunted by Bolgin and by Sabriel’s memory; sees herself as finishing the job his order failed to complete.
  - **Tension:**
    - Elder Council resents her unilateral actions but can’t easily dislodge her without starting a civil conflict.
    - Guard-Captain Lirael dislikes being outranked by an outsider but is forced to coordinate—or resist in subtle ways.

- **Guard-Captain Lirael (Local Security):**
  - Ridgeborne warrior; responsible for keeping peace in markets and upper decks.
  - Tries to:
    - Maintain order between Haven sympathizers, rebels, and terrified common folk.
    - Keep Alula from becoming a war camp entirely.
  - Potential ally or rival for Sabriel; respects competence and honesty.

---

## Factions & Tensions

- **Traditionalists (Council & Elders):**
  - Want survival, measured resistance, and spiritual balance.
  - Skeptical of Haven *and* of Witherwild-as-weapon.
  - Fear that Evelyn’s public executions and Wither-wielding will invite divine and ecological catastrophe.

- **Rebels (Fanewraith Loyalists):**
  - See Alula as a stronghold and symbol; willing to spill blood to protect it.
  - Idolize Fanewraith; many think the masked commander *is* her.
  - Believe compromise with Haven is betrayal.

- **Refugees & Commoners:**
  - Just want food, safety, and some stability.
  - Highly swayable by:
    - Demonstrations (like the upcoming public execution).
    - Visible acts of mercy or courage by PCs.
    - Who keeps them alive in the next crisis.

- **Quiet Haven Sympathizers & Spies:**
  - A few residents or visiting traders quietly share information with Haven:
    - For coin.
    - For fear of Witherwild.
    - Or genuine belief in the necessity of Lady’s Veil farms.
  - Their existence justifies Evelyn’s “traitor hunts”—even as she also uses them to silence opponents.

---

## Faint Divinities & Spiritual Life

- **Shrines & Practices:**
  - Upper levels hold shrines to:
    - **[[Ikla, the Sky Painter]]** – for safe travel across branches & clear skies.
    - **[[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]** – both beloved and feared; her flowers overgrow dangerously now.
  - Mid-level altars to:
    - **[[Rohkin, the Wandering Horn]]** – for safe herds near the forest floor.
    - Ancestral spirits and local guardian treants.

- **Thorngrowth Spiritual Debate:**
  - Was the Thorngrowth Spire a punishment ([[Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End]])?  
  - Or Hyacynis’s “self-defense” against Haven’s disruption?  
  - Or an echo of the Eye theft and Bolgin’s shattering?  
  Different factions answer differently, justifying their politics.

- **Oove & Nightveil:**
  - During Nightveil, Oove’s whispers are said to guide lost climbers back to platforms—or lure the faithless toward the Spire.

## New Key NPCs

### Evelyn DeVoss – “The Mask / The Wraith’s Hand”

> [!NOTE] DM Only  
> Sabriel served under Evelyn before Bolgin. She was believed dead when Bolgin was burned. Her “resurrection” as a Fanewraith commander is a major emotional and moral pivot.

- **Role:** Fanewraith officer in charge of Alula’s militant wing and current de facto military authority, appearing as the masked commander.
- **Look:** Tall, battle-hardened human; scar along jaw; wears a stylized mask (owl-and-thorn motifs), reinforced armor mixed from Stone Serpent gear and wild-grown plates.
- **Personality:** Controlled, charismatic, icy conviction. Genuinely believes:
  - Haven must be broken.
  - Traitors to Fanewick must die.
  - The wild will survive only if someone is ruthless enough to cut out rot.
- **Public Perception:**
  - To many, she *is* Fanewraith.
  - To others, she is “the sword” while Fanewraith is “the spirit”.
- **Hooks:**
  - Recognizes Sabriel; may taunt him about Bolgin, the invasion, and his atonement.
  - Oversees the **public execution**, personally poised to kill Theodore.
  - Potential for:
    - Duel.
    - Debate about what it means to “protect the meek”.
    - Stunning moment if mask is broken/removed.

### Theodore Underbrush – Fianna’s Father

- **Role:** Halfling bard and devotee of [[Nikta, the Great Owl]], accused as traitor.
- **Look:** Aging halfling with road-worn clothes, feather charms in hair, lute-callused fingers, tired eyes.
- **Backstory Here:**
  - Came to Alula seeking:
    - Clues to Nikta’s Reaping Eye.
    - Ways to restore balance rather than deepen war.
  - Spoke too openly to the wrong ears:
    - Questioned whether Fanewraith’s plan would truly help Nikta.
    - Met (or tried to meet) Haven intermediaries like Ambrose/Valerius.
  - Branded as:
    - **“Traitorthorn”** – accused of collaborating with Haven and betraying Fanewick’s cause.
- **Current Status:**
  - Imprisoned beneath the Hanging Hollow, pending public execution alongside other “thieves and traitors”.
- **Hooks:**
  - Fianna may hear his songs in secret before seeing him.
  - PCs can investigate:
    - Whether he truly betrayed anything.
    - Who set him up and why.
  - Could be rescued, swapped, or given a different fate depending on their choices.

### Mr Tilde – Smuggler & Fixer

- **Role:** Snicket’s contact; undercanopy broker of goods, information, and safe passage.
- **Look:** Slyborne (e.g. underborne, ribbet, or goblin) with mismatched clothing, ink-stained fingers, a perpetual half-smile.
- **Personality:** Pragmatic, risk-averse but opportunistic. Plays both sides, but leans toward whoever keeps trade flowing and the Wither off his doorstep.
- **Hooks:**
  - Holds:
    - Info about serpent coin networks.
    - Ledgers showing diverted Veil and rebel shipments.
  - Could trade:
    - A chance to reach Theodore before the execution.
    - Intel on Evelyn’s movements.
    - A path into or out of the execution plaza.

---

## Major Event: The Public Execution

**Working Title:** *“Roots and Ropes”* or *“The Thorn-Stage”*  

- **Premise:**  
  A spectacle staged by the masked commander to:
  - Demonstrate that “betrayers of Fanewick and the wild” will be punished.
  - Cement rebel control over Alula by fear and fervor.
  - Send a message to Haven and internal sympathizers: no mercy for traitors.

- **Planned Victims:**
  - **Theodore Underbrush** – framed as a collaborator with Haven, accused of:
    - Selling Nikta’s secrets.
    - Trying to return the Eye to “wrong hands.”
  - Other “thieves and traitors”:
    - A smuggler who sold Riverwalker routes to a Haven patrol.
    - A former guard who tipped off Serpents Hope about an earlier planned sabotage.
    - Possibly a captured Haven spy (depending on prior sessions).

- **Stage & Ritual:**
  - Execution by:
    - Hanging on vine-gallows.
    - Or impalement by thorn-growth commanded by Witherwild rites (more spectacular and terrifying).
  - Evelyn presides in full mask, flanked by:
    - Rebel guards.
    - A thorn-priest devoted to Qui’Gar or Hyacynis, “blessing” the spectacle.

- **Crowd Mood:**
  - Mixed:
    - Some baying for blood.
    - Some fearful but silent.
    - Some horrified, especially those who knew Theodore or the other accused.

### PC Interaction Options

- **Investigate Beforehand:**
  - Learn:
    - The charges.
    - The timeline.
    - Where prisoners are kept.
  - Possible mini-quests:
    - Track down witnesses who can confirm Theodore’s true actions.
    - Discover forged or altered evidence (ledgers, testimony).
    - Identify who pushed for this execution (Evelyn alone, or with Council blessing?).

- **Interrupt the Execution (Action / Heist):**
  - Options:
    - Direct assault on the stage (high-risk, dramatic).
    - Swap Theodore with a decoy or free him beforehand (stealth/social).
    - Sabotage the vine-gallows so the execution fails, turning crowd mood.
  - Consequences:
    - Rebuke from Elder Council who fear chaos.
    - Open enmity from Evelyn and hardcore rebels.
    - Potential uprising or split within Alula.

- **Change the Narrative (Social):**
  - Use the stage as a platform:
    - Sabriel can call out Evelyn’s past and question her authority.
    - Fern/Fianna can frame Theodore’s “betrayal” as an attempt to save balance, not break it.
  - If successful:
    - Crowd may insist on a trial instead of execution.
    - Council may intervene to stay the sentence.
    - Evelyn forced to retreat or show more overt cruelty, exposing herself.

- **Terrible Choice:**
  - PCs may fail or choose not to intervene:
    - Theodore dies.
    - Sabriel’s former mentor is confirmed as an unyielding enemy.
    - Fianna’s grief deepens; Brindle’s redemption and Eye restoration become more urgent.
  - This could unlock:
    - Visitations: Theodore’s spirit via Fern’s hedge rites.
    - Stronger Rohkin/Nikta omens.

   - PCs could:
     - Unmask a Haven spy about to be added to the execution list.
     - Decide whether to protect them, hand them over, or use them.

4. **Whispers of the Wandering Horn (Fianna/Brindle Lead):**

     - Herds maddened on the ground beneath the city.
     - Horns heard at night near the Spire.
   - PCs may:

     - Warnings that returning it blindly could cause a different imbalance.
   - After or instead of saving him, PCs can:
     - Follow these clues to shrines, weft-realms, or old Nikta worship sites.

Alula is now a powder keg: a vertical sanctuary where grief over the Thorngrowth Incident, fury at Haven, and fear of the Witherwild are all being channeled—sometimes wisely, sometimes disastrously—by elders trying to keep the peace and a masked commander who would rather break the world than let it be broken by someone else. How the PCs navigate this—especially around Theodore’s execution and the revelation of Evelyn’s identity—will define not just their standing in the city, but the tone of the rebellion and the balance of the wilds themselves.
