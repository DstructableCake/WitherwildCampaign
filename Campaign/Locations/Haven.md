# Overview

Haven was once the most powerful force in the region; for
centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase
“The Godless Gate.” While the original meaning has been
lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient
records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free
of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the
surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the
mightiest of these deities, known as [[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid]]. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their
victory ensured Haven’s dominance in the region for centuries
to come. They made their home behind his remains, which
became the mighty walls that Haven is known for.
