# Overview

Fanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow paths to their ruin. 

Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as quickly as it can cross the border. 

This wilderness fosters hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep them safe. 

These [[Wicklings]] remained insulated from their neighbors’ wars until plague forced the people of Haven todesperate acts.
