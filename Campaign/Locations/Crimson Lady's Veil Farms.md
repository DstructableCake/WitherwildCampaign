# Crimson Lady's Veil Farms

### Overview / Description

The Crimson Lady's Veil Farms stretch across what was once wild Fanewick territory, now transformed into regimented rows of crimson blooms under Haven's control. This vast agricultural complex represents Haven's most ambitious attempt to domesticate Fanewick's natural resources, but the land resists this forced cultivation.

The farms are divided into three distinct areas: the **Cultivation Fields** where the crimson flowers grow in endless rows, the **Storage Complex** where harvested blooms are processed and prepared for transport, and the **Living Quarters** where workers and overseers reside in a mix of Haven-built structures and repurposed Fanewick ruins.

- **Atmosphere:** Oppressive productivity marred by underlying tension. The beauty of the crimson blooms is overshadowed by the mechanical efficiency of their cultivation.
- **Sights:** Endless rows of crimson flowers, clanking harvesters, watchtowers, worker barracks, storage silos.
- **Sounds:** Mechanical clanking, worker voices, distant orders, the hum of processing equipment.
- **Smells:** Sweet floral scent mixed with metal oil, sweat, and the acrid tang of processed blooms.
- **Feel:** Dusty air, hard-packed earth, the vibration of machinery.
- **Taste:** Metallic tang in the air, floral pollen on the tongue.

### History

- **Pre-Invasion (Before Haven's Occupation):** This area was part of Fanewick's wild heartland, home to ancient groves and natural meadows where crimson lady's veil grew freely. The area was sacred to local Wickling communities who harvested the flowers for ceremonial purposes.

- **The Invasion (1-2 years ago):** Haven's forces cleared the area by force, driving out or subjugating the local Wickling communities. The ancient groves were cut down, the meadows plowed under, and the natural cycles disrupted to create the massive farm complex.

- **Current Era:** The farms operate under Haven's strict control, with Wickling workers forced to tend the very flowers that once grew wild in their homeland. The land itself seems to resist this forced cultivation, with strange growths and unexpected blooms appearing despite Haven's best efforts.
