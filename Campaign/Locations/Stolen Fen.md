### Overview / Description

- **General Description:** Once a series of treacherous bogs, now a stark, regimented landscape of white lady's veil fields, encroaching upon ancient Wickling ruins.
- **Sensory Details:** A sickly-sweet, cloying perfume from the lady's veil flowers dominates the air, contrasting with the underlying damp, earthy smell of the fen. The constant buzz of oversized insects and the distant, rhythmic _thump_ of Haven's harvesting machinery create a monotonous soundscape. In [[Day and Night|Nightveil]], the white flowers reflect the moon eerily, and the shadows of the Witherwild grow longer and more menacing.
- **Architecture & Layout:** Dominated by Haven's utilitarian structures: dirt roads, simple wooden barracks for guards, and large, cleared sections for planting. Patches of ancient, half-submerged Wickling ruins (stone foundations, weathered carvings) dot the landscape, a stark reminder of what was lost. Waterlogged ditches and canals, originally natural, are now engineered for irrigation by Haven.
- **Notable Features:**
    - **The Sea of White:** Vast expanses of lady's veil, a disquieting symbol of Fanewick's altered state.
    - **Ruined Shrines:** Partially submerged stone structures dedicated to Faint Divinities (e.g., Fulg, who once governed these waters, or perhaps lesser-known deities of bogs and reeds).
    - **Haven's Border Fires:** Automated patrols or strategic burning sites using Haven fires to keep the Witherwild growth from overwhelming the cultivated fields. These fires cast an unsettling orange glow at night.
- **Atmosphere:** A forced, unnatural tranquility, marred by underlying tension. It's a place of quiet desperation, where the beauty of the flowers is overshadowed by the sorrow of what they represent and the oppressive control exerted by Haven.

### Recent and Mid-Term History
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Recent History (Past 1-2 Years):** Haven's invasion focused on draining and cultivating these bogs for lady's veil following the Serpent's Sickness outbreak. Displaced [[Communities/Underborne]] and [[Ancestries/Galapa]] communities were forced into labor here, offering their resilience for Haven's "protection" (and continued existence). The Witherwild has begun its insidious encroachment, making the edges of the cultivated fields unpredictable and dangerous.
> - **Mid-Term History (Past 50-100 Years):** Stolen Fen was a known hazard, avoided by most. [[Communities/Underborne]] communities might have lived here, or [[Ancestries/Galapa]] relied on its unique flora and fauna. It was considered a wild, untamed territory, perhaps with Faint Divinities of marsh and water. There may have been ancient clashes between these communities and larger powers over resources or territory.
> - **Key Historical Events:** The draining and cultivation by Haven's forces, marking the literal "stealing" of the fen. The forced displacement of its original inhabitants, a trauma still felt by many Wicklings. The ongoing struggle against the encroaching Witherwild, which Haven forces attempt to contain with fire.

### Population and Demographics
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Population Size:** Variable; comprised of a garrison of [[Communities/Orderborne]] soldiers (perhaps 20-30) and a larger, fluctuating population of Wickling laborers (ranging from 50-100, depending on planting and harvesting seasons).
> - **Ancestries:** Dominant ancestries among laborers would be [[Ancestries/Galapa]] and [[Ribbet]] due to their connection to water/bogs, and any displaced [[Communities/Underborne]] families. Haven's forces would be predominantly Human, Dwarven, and [[Ancestries/Clank]]s.
> - **Communities:** [[Communities/Orderborne]] (Haven Army), [[Communities/Underborne]] / [[Ancestries/Galapa]] (forced labor), possibly some [[Communities/Wanderborne]] traders or scouts passing through.
> - **Age Profile:** Haven soldiers are typically young to middle-aged. Laborers are a mix, with elders often holding knowledge of the original fen and younger generations forced into service.
> - **Classes & Occupations:** Haven Soldiers (Warrior, Guardian); Laborers (various, often forced into basic farming or labor roles); Overseers (Orderborne, potentially with combat or social focus); possible Slyborne smugglers or informants operating on the periphery.
> - **Faint Divinity Affiliations:** Historically, deities of water, marsh, and perhaps spirits of the deep earth or lost souls. Now, their shrines are likely desecrated or ignored by Haven, creating spiritual imbalance. Hyacynis might find new favor in the cultivated blooms.

%%
### Hierarchy & Governance

- **Formal Structure:** Haven's Military Hierarchy. A Captain or Major (Orderborne, likely Warrior class) commands the garrison. Overseers manage the labor force. Archmage Phylax's directives dictate agricultural goals.
- **Informal Power:** Displaced [[Communities/Underborne]] elders who remember the fen's original state hold latent influence and knowledge. Rebel sympathizers may form quiet networks, potentially interacting with the Slyborne or Fanewraith.
- **Power Dynamics:** Haven's authority is absolute but maintained by force and strategic fires. Laborers live in fear and resentment. Hidden defiance simmers beneath the surface. Sabotage is rare but potentially devastating.

### Factions & Groups

- **Dominant Factions:** Haven Garrison (Orderborne).
- **Minor Factions:** Displaced Wickling Laborers (Galapa, Underborne, some Wildborne); potential Rebel Sympathizers (Slyborne contacts); Smuggler/Trader presence on the fringes.
- **Inter-Faction Relations:** Open hostility/fear between Haven forces and Wickling laborers. Smugglers bridge gaps, but operate cautiously. Rebels attempt to sow discord or recruit.
