# Monks Eliegh

### Overview / Description

Monks Eliegh is a once-thriving frontier town on Haven’s borderlands, now a **hollowed ruin marked by the Serpent Sickness**. The settlement lies in a shallow valley, its stone chapel at the center surrounded by abandoned homes and fields long since reclaimed by weeds.  

The town is infamous for its **statues** — the petrified remains of its people, frozen in their final prayers as the Sickness claimed them. A red serpent has been painted on the old watchtower, Haven’s mark for towns lost to plague.  

Today, the only living soul is **Priest [[Mathias Vanta]], who tends the chapel and keeps vigil among his stone congregation.  

- **Atmosphere:** Silent, heavy, suffused with grief. The air is dry and chalky, carrying the faint scent of incense and stone dust.  
- **Sights:** Empty streets, doors ajar, roofs sagging. Statues of townsfolk kneeling in prayer, faces turned toward the chapel.  
- **Sounds:** The whisper of wind through broken shutters, the faint crackle of a single candle in the chapel.  
- **Smells:** Dry dust, faint incense, acrid tang of old wax.  
- **Feel:** Cold stone surfaces, brittle wood, sticky wax.  
- **Taste:** Chalky air, grit on the tongue.  

%%  
> [!NOTE]  
> Monks Eliegh is a **haunting RP location** — not a combat space (unless you want to use Fear/Witherwild hallucinations). It’s a place to explore Sabriel’s trauma, guilt, and ties to Mathias. The statues are a perfect tool for **Fear Tokens**: describe them as shifting, whispering, or watching.

### History

- **Founding (Generations Ago):**  
  - A modest farming and trade town, supplying border villages and exchanging goods with Wicklings (iron tools, fortified alcohol for herbs and charms).  
  - Known for its chapel, where Havenites and Wicklings alike would pray together.  

- **The Serpent Sickness (2 years ago):**  
  - The plague swept through Monks Eliegh. In its final stages, victims gathered in the chapel to pray.  
  - They were petrified mid-prayer, leaving the chapel filled with stone figures.  
  - Haven marked the town with a red serpent, declaring it lost.  

- **The Invasion (1 year ago):**  
  - Sabriel fought in the vanguard, hoping to secure a cure for his town. By the time he returned, it was too late.  
  - His family and neighbors were already stone.  

- **Current Era:**  
  - The town is abandoned, except for Mathias.  
  - Sabriel visits monthly, bringing supplies and checking on the priest.  

%%  
> [!NOTE]  
> Monks Eliegh is a **symbol of Haven’s failure** — abandoned border towns, sacrificed for the greater war effort. It’s also a **mirror for Sabriel’s guilt**: he fought to save them, but returned too late.

### Population and Demographics

- **Current Population:** 1 (Mathias Vanta).  
- **Former Population:** ~300 (farmers, traders, families).  
- **Now:** All petrified by the Serpent Sickness.  

- **Demographics (before the fall):**  
  - 70% Havenite humans (farmers, smiths, traders).  
  - 20% Wicklings (fauns, elves, fungril) who came for trade or lived on the border.  
  - 10% others (wanderborne merchants, ribbet smugglers).  

%%  
> [!NOTE]  
> The **statues** can be described in detail to personalize the tragedy:  
> - A child clutching a toy.  
> - A farmer with hands clasped.  
> - A mother shielding her child.  
> - A Wickling trader with prayer beads.  
>  
> Use these to spotlight Sabriel’s memories, or to give other PCs eerie RP moments.

### Key Figures

- **Mathias Vanta (Priest):**  
  - Old, gaunt, steadfast. Keeps vigil in the chapel.  
  - Believes the statues still hear his prayers.  
  - Grateful to Sabriel, but gently reminds him: *“You cannot carry them all, Sabriel. The stone is not yours to bear.”*  

- **The Statues (Former Townsfolk):**  
  - Frozen mid-prayer, haunting reminders of the plague.  
  - PCs may recognize details (Sabriel’s family, Wickling traders, children).  
  - Can be used as **Fear triggers** (whispers, shifting, watching).

### Ties to Campaign

- **Sabriel:**  
  - His hometown, his trauma, his guilt.  
  - Visits Mathias monthly, bringing supplies.  
  - This is why he discarded his armor and wanders — endless pilgrimage to atone.  

- **Other PCs:**  
  - Snicket may see smuggler’s marks on old buildings.  
  - Fern/Gnirth may feel the Fungril network pulse faintly in the chapel.  
  - Fianna may see the statues as a wound in Nikta’s cycle.  

- **Kreil’s Note Delivery (Alternative):**  
  - The folded note lies beneath the chapel’s candle, half-buried in wax.  
  - Mathias swears he did not place it there.  
  - Text:  
    > *“I have been observing you through the network.  
    > Your help will be needed to avoid a great threat.  
    > Meet me at the Old Weir by next Nightveil.  
    > Bring only a trusted few.”*  

%%  
> [!NOTE]  
> - Monks Eliegh is a **perfect place for Kreil’s note** — eerie, deniable, and personal.  
> - The candle delivery makes it feel like the message has been waiting for them.  
> - Fear Tokens:  
>   - Candle gutters violently when touched.  
>   - Statues seem to shift in the corner of the eye.  
>   - Whispers echo in the chapel.
