### Nikta Connection/ Link to the Greater Struggles

- **Place in the World:** Eastern Fanewick mountains, a strategic vantage in the invasion tensions.
- How does this place think of/ treat [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]], is she feared, worshipped or both? Does anyone know about the ongoing plight, where the removal of the [[Reaping Eye]] was removed from [[Nikta, the Great Owl]] that plunged into perpetual Spring: Nikta is feared for her seasonal shifts but worshipped with peak vigils; scouts know the eye removal from signals, attributing crystal growth to her imbalance.
