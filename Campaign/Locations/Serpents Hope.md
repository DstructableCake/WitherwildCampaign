# Serpents Hope (Crimson Lady’s Veil Farms)

## Overview / Description

- **Type:** Haven-controlled agricultural complex in Fanewick  
- **Function:** Major production site for **Lady’s Veil** (the red flower refined into Veils / red potion that counters Serpents Sickness), plus other medical and supply crops.  
- **Location:** Borderlands between Haven’s fortified front and Fanewick’s deeper wilds, reachable from [[Low Passage]] and the Nightveil tunnels; roughly downstream from the [[The Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds]] and upriver from [[Stolen Fen]].

- **Landscape & Layout:**  
  Serpents Hope is less a single farm and more a stitched-together complex of fields, warehouses, and barracks perched in a shallow valley:

  - **Crimson Fields:**  
    Long, orderly rows of Lady’s Veil flowers—white petals with crimson centers—once stretched in neat blocks across gentle slopes. After the siege, many plots now lie blackened, churned, or grey-stained by ooze; some rows still stand, isolated islands of careful cultivation amid scars.

  - **Warehouses & Processing:**  
    Two large timber-and-stone warehouses sit near the central road:
    - One primarily used for **fresh Lady’s Veil storage** and first-stage processing.
    - One for **general supplies** (grain, tools, spare clank parts).
    Their walls bear scorch marks and hasty repairs where the **Wither Touched Stag** smashed through and Flameburst Fireflies set fires.

  - **Living Quarters & Camps:**  
    A cluster of tents, simple houses, and long barracks to one side:
    - Wickling workers’ homes (mudbrick, wood, woven reed).
    - Haven guard barracks and a central command tent for the quartermaster.
    - Simple field-tents used as triage and infirmaries after the siege.

  - **Clank Lines & Infrastructure:**  
    Mechanical harvesters (“clanks”) trundle on set paths through some fields, their tracks turning soil into hard-packed lanes. Irrigation channels branch out from a diverted stream, with pumps and small footbridges connecting rows.

  - **Watchtowers & Walls:**  
    Low earth berms and wooden palisades ring parts of the complex, anchored by a few watchtowers. They are more designed to deter beasts and raiders than full-scale assaults from the Witherwild.

- **Atmosphere:**  
  In peacetime, Serpents Hope feels like a hard but hopeful frontier—workers laughing in the evenings, clanks humming, rows of flowers like a promise of life against the Sickness.  
  After the events of Session 6–7, it feels **shell-shocked**:
  - Patches of black-stained soil where the **Leshen Warden** and ooze erupted.
  - Repaired but mismatched walls.
  - Workers moving with that brittle mix of gratitude and grief.
  - An underlying hum of worry: this was a test, not the end.

## Recent and Mid-Term History

### Recent History (Last 1–5 years)

- **Farm Expansion & Sickness Demand:**
  - Serpents Hope was expanded aggressively once Lady’s Veil proved effective against Serpents Sickness.
  - Production quotas rose each season; new fields were cut into Fanewick soil, often faster than local spirits or Wicklings thought wise.
  - Clanks and irrigation works were added to drive yield even higher, giving the farm its distinctive blend of arcane-industrial and rustic.

- **Tension with Fanewick Locals:**
  - Wickling workers were “hired” or coerced into labor, caught between Haven’s pay and their land’s pain.
  - Nearby Wildborne & Riverwalker clans regarded the farm as a **scar**—a necessary evil to some, sacrilege to others.

- **Subtle Corruption Pre-Siege:**
  - Clank malfunctions grew more common—gears jamming with black sap, pumps sucking up odd sludge.
  - Workers whispered of strange animals at night: glass-winged moths drifting over fields, thorns growing where no thornbush was planted.
  - A few minor Wither incursions were suppressed; Haven reports called them “anomalies.”

- **The Siege of Serpents Hope (Sessions 6–7):**
  - A coordinated three-point assault struck at dawn (unusual for such attacks):
    - **Living Quarters:**  
      Flameburst Fireflies and a **Briarback Boar** drove fire and panic into workers’ homes.
    - **Warehouses:**  
      **Bloodwings** and a **Wither Touched Stag** aimed to destroy stored Lady’s Veil.
    - **Fields:**  
      **Glasswing Moths** and an **Earthrend Molebeast** churned fields and seeded corruption.
  - The party’s intervention:
    - Saved many civilians and a large portion of immediate Lady’s Veil stock.
    - Failed to protect several fields from deep taint.
    - Ultimately slew the **Leshen Warden** that erupted from ooze at the field’s heart, driving back the worst of the corruption—for now.

- **Aftermath:**
  - Immediate Lady’s Veil supplies for Haven were preserved; no short-term shortage.
  - Long-term productivity is crippled: many fields must lie fallow or be abandoned.
  - The **black ooze** seeped deep; some soil may never safely grow Veil again without serious intervention.
  - The attack’s *timing and coordination*—especially at daybreak—strongly suggest **Fanewraith’s hand** guiding Witherwild and beasts.

### Mid-Term History (Past Decades)

- **Founding:**
  - Built during or shortly after Haven’s major push into Fanewick’s bogs, when half of Haven was dying or recovering from Serpents Sickness.
  - Intended as a symbol of hope and control: “Serpents Hope” as both name and statement.

- **Border Function:**
  - Serves as a **logistic node**:
    - Refining and forwarding Lady’s Veil to Haven.
    - Housing a rotating garrison to watch nearby wilds.
    - Providing a waystation for patrols moving between Stolen Fen, the barracks near [[Monks Eliegh]], and deeper into Fanewick.

- **Growing Resentment:**
  - As the immediate crisis of the Sickness eased, questions grew:
    - Wicklings: “How much more land must be carved up to feed their cities?”  
    - Haven: “How much more Witherwild risk is worth one more shipment?”

- **Early Sabotage:**
  - Before the full siege, minor incidents:
    - Tools disappearing.
    - Clank “accidents.”
    - Veil tallies not matching ledger records (echoing Snicket’s discoveries about tampered distributions).

## Population and Demographics

- **Total Population (Pre-Siege):**  
  ~150–220 people on-site at any one time, more during harvest peaks.

- **Makeup:**
  - **Workers (60–80):**  
    - Mostly Wicklings and other Fanewick locals forced by circumstance to take Haven pay.
    - A mix of field laborers, planters, cutters, and handlers.
  - **Haven Personnel (25–40):**
    - **Guards:** Border soldiers rotated from nearby barracks.
    - **Handlers & Technicians:** Clank operators, pump engineers, record-keepers.
    - **Command:** Led by a Quartermaster rather than a full military commander.
  - **Dependents & Families (20–40):**
    - Worker families, children, elders.
  - **Transient Presence:**  
    - Occasional merchant caravans, healers, inspectors, and sometimes covert agents (e.g. spies, smugglers) moving through.

- **Classes & Occupations:**
  - Laborers, herbalists, clank handlers, guards, field medics.
  - A few low-level casters (healer-priests, magewrights) to stabilize Veil storage and help with injuries.

- **Age Profile:**
  - Many working-age adults.
  - Notable number of children and elderly among the Wickling families.
  - Guards skew younger—fresh recruits or border veterans rotated in.

---

## Hierarchy & Governance

- **Formal Command (Haven):**
  - **Quartermaster Brill** – official head of the farm:
    - Handles quotas, shipments, guard rotations, and reports to Haven.
    - Caught between orders from above and the reality on the ground.
  - **Clank Handlers & Specialist Leads:**
    - Oversee machinery and critical functions like irrigation and storage.
  - **Guard Sergeant / Corporal Ranks:**
    - Maintain discipline, patrol, and perimeter defense.

- **Informal Authority (Local):**
  - **Steward Vel** – Wickling community leader:
    - Organizes worker schedules and tries to protect his people.
    - Mediates between Haven command and Wickling needs.
  - Trusted herbalists, elders, and “old hands” on the farm carry social weight.

- **Decision-Making:**
  - Strategic decisions driven by Haven orders and Brill’s judgment.
  - Day-to-day survival often hinges on Steward Vel’s experience and worker initiative.
  - In crisis (like the siege), command fragments: guards follow Brill, workers cluster around Vel, and specialists like Pex improvise.

---

## Factions & Groups

- **Haven Command & Guards (Institutional):**
  - Believe in the mission: Lady’s Veil saves lives in Haven cities.
  - Increasingly uneasy about Witherwild escalation and limited manpower.
  - Some see Wicklings as allies; some see them as expendable.

- **Wickling Workers & Families (Local):**
  - Ambivalent and divided:
    - Grateful for coin, medicine, and some protection from worse things in the wild.
    - Angry at land overuse, dangerous quotas, and being caught in the middle of faction wars.
  - Lean toward **traditionalist Fanewick divinity respect**, even if they mouth Haven prayers for safety.

- **Clank Handlers / Technicians:**
  - Often Haven-born; view the farm through a lens of machinery and problem-solving.
  - Many (like Pex) are naïve to political tension: they just want their machines and fields to “hum properly”.

- **Hidden Sympathizers / Quiet Rebels:**
  - A few workers or staff quietly supportive of **Fanewraith** or other rebel causes.
  - May have manipulated clanks or records before the siege, or smuggled info through places like [[Low Passage]].

---

## Faint Divinity & Spiritual Context

- **Officially:**  
  Serpents Hope is a Haven operation; worship of Haven’s recognized gods and saints occurs in small shrines or private devotions.

- **In Practice:**
  - Many workers still make **quiet tributes** to:
    - **Rohkin, the Wandering Horn** – hoping herds will graze safely and not stampede through fields.
    - **Fulg, Stacker of Stones** – asking for stable earth and secure foundations (linking to Fern’s cairn encounter on the road).
    - Local field spirits and ancestral guardians of the land, whose shrines have sometimes been co-opted or bulldozed.

- **Spiritual Imbalance:**
  - After the siege, it is hard to deny:
    - The land is pushing back.
    - Fields feel “angry,” and some shrines feel “cold” or “silent.”
  - The rise of the **Leshen Warden** is seen by many as proof that faint divinities or land-spirits—possibly tied to [[Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End]] or other thorn-bound powers—are getting dragged into this conflict.

---

## Serpents Hope After the Siege (Current Status)

- **Fields:**
  - Several plots are unusable for the foreseeable future: ooze-blackened, cracked, or still faintly pulsing with Witherwild residue.
  - Some rows remain viable; others might be redeemed with powerful rites or long, careful fallowing.

- **Supplies:**
  - Immediate Lady’s Veil stock was largely saved thanks to the party’s defense.
  - Short-term Haven needs are covered; long-term yield is significantly reduced.

- **Morale:**
  - Workers: grateful but fearful; they have seen what happens when the wild fights back.
  - Guards: shaken; they’ve fought things their training barely prepared them for.
  - Brill: torn between duty and doubt; his reports will be heavy with caveats and quiet warnings.

- **Corruption Risk:**
  - Black ooze remains in deep furrows and subsoil.
  - Without further intervention, Witherwild presence here may slowly expand or send out “echoes” (future Leshens, mutated beasts, creeping taint downriver).

---

## Potential Quest Hooks & Follow-Ups

- **The Black Furrows (Cleanup / Ritual):**
  - Brill and Vel ask the PCs (especially Fern/Gnirth/Fianna) to help **purge or contain** the ooze-saturated plots:
    - Hedge rituals to stabilize the land.
    - Water manipulation/harmony rites to absolve or redirect taint.
    - Negotiations with faint divinities offended by the farm’s expansion.

- **Echoes Downriver (Gnirth Focus):**
  - The ooze’s behavior suggests it’s part of a **larger network** tied to Tideveil and the Sowing Eye fallout.
  - PCs might follow residue downriver into the [[The Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds]] or up toward Alula’s roots.

- **Worker Unrest (Social):**
  - Some workers now openly blame Haven for painting a target on their backs.
  - Others whisper about **joining Fanewraith** or other rebel causes.
  - PCs could mediate, choose sides, or accidentally push Serpents Hope into open labor conflict.

- **Haven’s Response (Political):**
  - Additional orders from Haven may:
    - Demand further expansion to “make up lost yield.”
    - Tighten control over workers and guard rotations.
    - Push more risky experiments with Witherwild creatures (like the hunters’ cages from Session 5).

- **Daybreak Patterns (Investigative):**
  - The unusual timing of the siege (at dawn rather than Nightveil) is a clue:
    - Suggests someone inside or near the farms fed precise routine info to Fanewraith.
    - A future investigation may uncover infiltrators, serpent coins, or compromised ledgers.

---

## Connections to Other Locations

- **To Alula:**
  - Natural overland route via the Great River, passing through or near the [[The Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds]].
  - Rumors say corruption is “worse” around Alula, with Withered growth climbing into the canopy.

- **To Monks Eliegh & Barracks:**
  - Serpents Hope depends on reinforcement from border barracks near [[Monks Eliegh]].
  - Messages and survivors travel back and forth; intel about Fanewraith and the Eyes flows along this route.

- **To Low Passage:**
  - Some supplies and black-market components move to/from Serpents Hope via hidden routes and smugglers linked to [[Low Passage]].
  - Tampered Veil records and serpent coin networks likely cross through here.

---

Serpents Hope now stands as a **scar that still bleeds**: a place where the desperate practicality of Haven’s survival has slammed hard into the living will of Fanewick’s land. It is a powerful touchstone for themes of sacrifice, exploitation, balance, and the long shadow of both gods and mortals.
