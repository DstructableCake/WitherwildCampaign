# The Riverwalkers’ Hunting Grounds

## Overview / Description

- **General Description:**  
  A long, wild stretch of the **Great River** running between Haven’s farm-belt (e.g. [[Serpents Hope]], [[Stolen Fen]]) and the treetop stronghold of [[Alula]]. This is one of the few practical routes into Fanewick’s heart that avoids both Haven roads and the deepest [[WitherWild]] pockets—part corridor, part sanctuary, part trap.

- **Landscape:**  
  Lush riverbanks of ancient trees and dense undergrowth, cut by game-trails and old fords. The terrain feels vertical and layered:
  - High river bluffs with old hunter blinds.
  - Lower banks with reed-choked shallows and slippery stone crossings.
  - Pockets of open meadow where herds drink at dusk.

- **Subtle Corruption:**  
  The Witherwild hasn’t fully claimed the grounds—yet. Most changes are unsettling rather than overtly monstrous:
  - Deer with bark-like ridges beneath their fur or an extra golden eye.
  - Fish whose scales catch the light at strange angles, eyes a little too reflective.
  - Reeds and ferns threaded with faint black veining, still green but “wrong”.
  - Occasional bioluminescent fungi or blooms in deep shade, faint Oove-like glows at the wrong hour.

- **Silent Signs & Spirit Cairns:**  
  The Riverwalkers mark their territory with signs most outsiders miss:
  - **Trail Marks:** Feather carvings on bark, triple-stacked stones, knotted reeds—codes for “safe ford”, “cursed ground”, “meeting place”.
  - **Spirit Cairns:** Stacks of river stones with offerings (antler chips, feathers, bits of rusted Haven steel). Some subtly shift position between visits. Elders say the river itself “rearranges them to warn of coming danger”.

- **Atmosphere:**  
  A blend of stark natural beauty and quiet unease. The land feels *aware*: paths never quite the same, the river’s eddies seeming to watch back. It’s serene if respected—and quick to turn hostile if taken for granted.

## Recent and Mid-Term History

- **Geographic Role (Last 10–20 years):**  
  The hunting grounds form a natural corridor:
  - For [[Communities/Wildborne]] clans and [[Communities/Wanderborne]] caravans entering Fanewick’s interior.
  - For smugglers and quiet travelers avoiding Haven patrol roads.
  - As one of the safest ways to move between [[Serpents Hope]] and [[Alula]] without walking under banners.

- **Recent History (Last 1–5 years):**  
  - Witherwild incursions up-river and the theft of Nikta’s Eye have started to warp local fauna.
  - Herds are more skittish, changing routes and seasons; some traditional fords “feel wrong”.
  - Haven pressure (labs, hunters, specimen-harvesters) pushes more desperate people onto river routes, grinding old Riverwalker patience thin.
  - Rumors of **mutated predators**—thorn-sided wolves, glass-eyed owls—circulate, but so far they remain scattered incidents, not yet a full-blown nightmare.

- **The Great Hunt of the Withered Stag (Legend):**  
  Generations ago, Riverwalker songs tell of a monstrous stag twisted by an early strain of the Witherwild. Its antlers grew like living briars; its breath carried choking spores. The Riverwalkers tracked it for days along these banks and finally brought it down in a blood-red bloom of river water and petals.  
  Recently, elders mutter that the tale is waking up again. News from [[Serpents Hope]] of a **Wither Touched Stag** tearing through the crimson fields matches the old story too closely for comfort. To them, this isn’t a new monster—it’s the Great Hunt repeating.

- **Early Witherwild Incursions:**  
  Long before Haven’s invasion, lesser taints appeared here—crooked antlers, odd shadows—then receded. The current changes feel different: smarter, heavier, as if something further up-river (or deeper down-river, toward Tideveil) has shifted.

## Population and Demographics

- **Usage Pattern:**  
  This is not a permanent settlement but a seasonal, living territory used by:
  - **[[Communities/Wildborne]] Riverwalkers** – skilled Wickling hunters native to these banks.
  - **[[Communities/Wanderborne]] caravans** – who camp briefly, then move on.
  - Occasional **refugees** from Wither or Serpents Sickness looking for a way around Haven.

- **Riverwalkers (Core Group):**
  - Primarily Wicklings and faun-blooded folk accustomed to tree and river life.
  - Live in mobile camps: hide tents, woven reed shelters, tree-platform blinds.
  - Age spread: active hunters are mostly adults, but elders command spiritual and tactical respect, and youth learn the codes of cairns and signs.

- **Other Folk:**
  - Stray [[Rangers]] and [[Classes/Druid|Druids]] from other communities seeking work, sanctuary, or lore.
  - A few **Galapa** or other amphibious ancestries who dwell closer to the waterline.
  - Smugglers and slyborne pass through quietly, trying not to draw Riverwalker ire.

## Hierarchy & Governance

- **Structure:**  
  No formal state, but a tight clan-based code:
  - Decisions made by a **council of elder hunters and shamans**, typically riverside around cairns.
  - Leadership is earned via a mix of **prowess** (tracking, fighting, guiding) and **wisdom** (respect for spirits, river cycles, and balance).
  - Outlanders have no say; they are guests, burdens, or prey depending on behavior.

- **Spiritual Guidance:**  
  Shamans and elders interpret omens from:
  - The behavior of herds and fish.
  - The rearrangement of spirit cairns.
  - Dreams and visions granted by [[Rohkin, the Wandering Horn]] and lesser river spirits.

- **Justice & Disputes:**
  - Most disputes settled by mediation around cairns or through trials of skill (tracking, archery, reading the river).
  - Serious offenses against the land (poisoning water, pointless slaughter) can result in banishment or “losing the path”—being guided out and never allowed to return.

---

## Factions & Groups

- **Riverwalkers (Dominant Faction):**  
  A loose collective of Wildborne hunters and guides dedicated to:
  - Living off the river with minimal permanent mark.
  - Keeping herds, fish, and people moving along their proper cycles.
  - Resisting both Haven overreach and uncontrolled Witherwild.

- **Quiet Traditionalists:**  
  Elders and conservative hunters who:
  - Want minimal entanglement with Haven or rebel politics.
  - Believe balance can still be restored here if the worst wars pass them by.
  - Are increasingly worried that doing nothing may no longer be enough.

- **River-Sympathizers (Pro-Rebel Lean):**  
  Younger hunters and some slyborne accents who:
  - Share rumors, passage, and food with [[Fanewraith]]’s agents when they feel Haven has stepped too far.
  - Justify it as “striking upstream to protect downstream” from more farms and labs.
  - Are uneasy about Witherwild-aligned methods, but angrier at Haven’s scars.

- **Skeptics of Fanewraith:**  
  Riverwalkers who:
  - Blame Haven for much but see **Fanewraith’s extremism** as courting disaster.
  - Fear that summoning more Witherwild power will make the river itself unlivable.
  - Might quietly cooperate with outsiders if they believe it will avoid more catastrophic magic.

## Faint Divinity Affiliations

- **[[Rohkin, the Wandering Horn]] (Primary Patron):**
  - Protector of herds, wild paths, and right timing of migrations.
  - Riverwalkers leave antler shards, braided grasses, and carved horn totems at cairns.
  - Omens have grown restless: herds stampede at nothing, storms roll in without rain, and some calves are born twisted or black-veined.

- **Lesser River Spirits:**
  - Names like **Lathun, the Drowned Path** and **Murea of the Bending Current** are invoked at crossings and fords.
  - Offerings: copper coins, feathers, smooth stones tossed into eddies.
  - Old rule: “Drop something you can’t bear to lose, to prove you can bear to lose the crossing.”

- **Other Divinities in the Air:**
  - Whispered respect for [[Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom]] during Nightveil—glow-fungi often line their night paths.
  - Uneasy muttering about [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]] where overgrowth feels more like a rash than a blessing.

## Fanewraith’s Connection / Rebel Activity

- **Rebel Use of the Grounds:**
  - Agents aligned with [[Fanewraith]] occasionally:
    - Move along hidden paths parallel to the river, avoiding both Haven and Riverwalker patrols.
    - Harvest rare Withered components from localized corruption pockets (thorny hides, glassy moth shards, tainted reeds).
    - Use secluded river bends and cairn clearings as neutral meeting spots with smugglers and slyborne contacts.

- **Riverwalker Attitudes Toward Fanewraith:**
  - **Sympathizers:**  
    - See Haven as the larger, more immediate threat.  
    - Believe Fanewraith’s strikes at farms and labs upstream may spare the river downstream.  
    - Offer food, rumors, or a quiet lookout when they think it won’t bring Witherwild directly to their banks.
  - **Skeptics/Opponents:**  
    - Fear her growing relationship with the Witherwild and thorn-divinities like [[Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End]].  
    - Worry that if more Leshen-like guardians rise, the river will become undrinkable, the grounds unlivable.  
    - Might ally with PCs who show they oppose both Haven abuse and reckless Witherwild escalation.

- **PC-Relevant Intel:**
  - Riverwalkers can mention rumors of:
    - A “thorn-masked woman” seen once, standing on a far bank, herds refusing to drink near her.  
    - Dead drops or meeting signs used by Fanewraith cells (e.g. right-coiled reed bundles).

## Potential Quest Hooks & Encounter Seeds

> These are options; pick and remix as needed.

### 1. The Tainted Ford

- **Situation:**  
  A traditional crossing has gone bad: black-veined algae on stones, sideways eddies, small dead fish washing up. Riverwalkers are starting to avoid it, but caravans still need a way across.
- **PC Role:**  
  - Investigate, cleanse, or redirect the taint.  
  - Use Fern’s hedge magic, Gnirth’s water control, and Fianna’s Rohkin prayers.  
- **Payoff:**  
  Securing the ford earns strong Riverwalker goodwill and hints that **corruption follows watercourses**—important for Gnirth’s Tideveil arc.

### 2. The Herd That Won’t Drink

- **Situation:**  
  Rohkin’s herd refuses to drink from a once-clean bend. Calves are thirsty and restless; predators circle.
- **PC Role:**  
  - Discover why (hidden ooze seep, subtle spirit anger, or an unseen Fanewraith cache).  
  - Choose to cleanse, reroute the herd, or bargain with whatever spirit has claimed the water.
- **Payoff:**  
  Direct tie-in to **Brindle’s potential cure**; Fianna can see how balancing beast, spirit, and taint might work.

### 3. The Wounded Riverwalker

- **Situation:**  
  A hunter is found bitten by a partially Withered beast. The wound’s veins darken in a pattern that looks familiar (Serpents Hope ooze, Tideveil flood).
- **PC Role:**  
  - Try experimental cures (Fern’s bones and hedge rites, Gnirth’s “diluting” waters, Fianna’s nature magic).  
  - Decide whether to risk further corruption or accept harsh measures.
- **Payoff:**  
  Morality and horror; a small-scale “trial run” for future, bigger cures—and a deepening bond with the clan.

### 4. The Silent Cairn

- **Situation:**  
  One spirit cairn has stopped humming. Stones keep falling, offerings rot quickly, animals avoid the spot.
- **PC Role:**  
  - Investigate a break between land and spirit (maybe linked to stolen tributes, a rebel misuse of the shrine, or Haven pollution dumped upriver).  
- **Payoff:**  
  Re-tuning a cairn may draw direct attention from a minor river spirit—or even a brief sign from Rohkin.

## Bringing the PCs Here (Hooks Summary)

- **Theodore’s Trail:**  
  Riverwalkers confirm Fianna’s father travelled along the river toward [[Alula]] and played for their camp.

- **Brindle’s Cure:**  
  Elders say the first steps to mend Withered beasts must begin where herds still *almost* drink safely: here.

- **Gnirth’s Past:**  
  Water shamans and the Galapa hermit recognize echoes of Tideveil in him, pointing him to specific corrupted bends.

- **Mr Tilde & Smuggling:**  
  Contacts tell [[Snicket Surefoot]] that “Tilde’s parcels” move under Riverwalker eyes—follow their cairns and signs to find his trail.

- **Safer Route to Alula:**  
  [[Quartermaster Brill]] or others suggest the river path as the best way to reach Alula without marching under Haven banners.

All together, the Riverwalkers’ Hunting Grounds become more than a travel segment: they are a living, remembering threshold between Haven’s scars and Fanewick’s heart, full of small mysteries, moral choices, and threads tied directly to your PCs’ stories.
