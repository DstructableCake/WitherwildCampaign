## **Scene 1 – Aftermath at the Weir**

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The cave dust finally settles, revealing cracks in the stone from the collapse. The assassin's body lies still, black ichor pooling from his wounds, while your hogtied prisoner squirms against his ropes, eyes flashing defiance. Outside, the fen hums with midday life—birds calling, water lapping—but the air inside carries the metallic tang of blood and lingering smoke. Kreil's map lies unfolded, pointing westward to Alula, a silent reminder of the path ahead.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Dust motes in faint sunlight, prisoner's bound form twitching, black-veined wounds on the dead assassin.
- **Sound:** Prisoner's muffled grunts, distant fen wildlife, your own ragged breaths.
- **Smell:** Metallic blood, damp stone, faint acrid Wither taint.
- **Touch:** Cold cave floor, rough ropes on the prisoner, adrenaline fading to fatigue.
- **Taste:** Bitter aftermath of combat, dry mouth from exertion.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- The party can interrogate the hogtied assassin (bound and gagged, but removable for talk).
- Examine Kreil's map: It shows a 10-12 day route to Alula, with hidden paths avoiding patrols.

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Prisoner hints at Fanewraith's network in Alula, tying to the Sowing Eye plot.
- Black ichor on bodies connects to Witherwild corruption, echoing Gnirth's origin explosion.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend Fear to make the prisoner spit a veiled threat (e.g., "The Root Mother sees all"), adding a minor condition like Dazed to one PC; gaining Fear feels like a creeping doubt, as if unseen eyes watch.
- **Medium:** Spend Fear to have the prisoner's wounds ooze contagiously, forcing an Instinct save or minor Wither taint (e.g., -1 to next roll); gaining Fear feels like a sickly nausea, skin crawling with invisible roots.
- **High:** Spend Fear to summon a minor Wither hybrid (e.g., tainted bird) that attacks briefly before fleeing; gaining Fear feels like suffocating paranoia, the fen itself turning hostile.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** Turning to you, Fern—what does the Fungril network whisper about this prisoner's corrupted aura? (Prompt a Hedge Witch ritual or Instinct check for insights on Wither taint.)
- **Fianna:** Fianna, seeing this bound fanatic reminds you of Brindle's suffering—what urges you to do? (Prompt a Druidic commune or Presence check to sense motives.)
- **Gnirth:** Gnirth, the prisoner's watery eyes stir a fragmented memory—how do you probe his mind? (Prompt a Sorcerer mind-read or Arcana check for void-tied secrets.)
- **Sabriel:** Sabriel, as the guardian, what do you demand from this prisoner to protect the group? (Prompt a Knight intimidation or Strength check for info extraction.)
- **Snicket:** Snicket, you spot a serpent-coin sigil on his belt—how would you leverage your smuggling knowledge? (Prompt a Rogue investigation or Finesse check for hidden clues.)

**GM Options / Variations:**

- If interrogation succeeds: Prisoner reveals a Dustveil contact in Alula but clams up on more.
- Variation A (Social Focus): Extend RP with moral debate on killing vs. sparing him.
- Variation B (Horror Focus): His taint spreads if untied, leading to a quick mercy-kill dilemma.

**Transition Line:**  
With the prisoner secured and map in hand, the party heads back toward Monks Eliegh, the sun dipping lower as decisions loom.

## Interrogation

NPC: Captured Assassin (Fanewraith Cell Knife)

- Look/feel: Lean, mud-slick cloak, fanewoven wrist-wrap threaded with blackened vine fibers. A coin with a serpent biting its tail tied at the belt.
- Voice: Whispery, clipped; every sentence weighed. Takes long blinks like he’s listening to a distant rhythm.
- Personality: Fatalistic zealot, but pragmatic under pressure; respects competence; contempt for Haven officers; oddly courteous to Fern/Fianna (recognizes nature-links).
- Soundbites:
    - “Names are roots. Pull one, you bring the tree down.”
    - “Elara Voss? You don’t speak a storm’s name and expect calm seas.”
    - “Alula’s shade keeps secrets better than your iron cells.”
    - “The Eye belongs to the world, not to vaults and idols.”

Interrogation Mechanics (simple track you can run behind the screen)

- Use a 3-stage resistance track: Steady → Strained → Cracked.
- Each strong success on a relevant check advances 1 stage (Presence/Intimidate, Finesse/Deceive, Knowledge/Network, Instinct/Empathy, Arcana/Occult).
- Compelling leverage (evidence, personal tie, credible threat) grants advantage or counts as a partial stage bump.
- A failure can:
    - Add 1 Fear to the GM pool, or
    - Regress 1 stage if the party is fractious, or
    - Trigger a trained counter (false lead, silence, or bite-attempt).
- At “Cracked,” each further success yields 1 concrete, actionable detail.

Suggested DC feel: Difficulty 12 baseline, 14 if the approach clashes with his values (e.g., hollow threats), 10 if he respects the interrogator’s ethos (e.g., a nature-vowed plea, a soldier-to-soldier code).

Safety throttle

- He will not reveal: current location of the Fanewraith, exact Rite timing mechanism, Veilshade’s identity or direct link to Dustveil leadership.
- He can reveal: local cells, rendezvous customs, decoys, faction rumors, geographic cues, and “next-step” leads toward Alula.

Leverage and Approaches

- Fern/Fianna (empathy/faith): “This corruption isn’t balance.” Offer respectful last rites or a chance to send a message to kin. Check: Presence (empathy) or Instinct (divine/nature insight).
- Sabriel (authority/war): “You attacked a parley. Help us stop more deaths.” Offer honorable custody vs. brig. Check: Presence (command) or Strength (intimidation).
- Snicket (criminal savvy): Produce the serpent coin; speak in smugglers’ cant; trade small intel for bigger intel. Check: Finesse (deceive) or Knowledge (underworld).
- Gnirth (occult pressure): Subtle water-bind/steam threat; or a mind-skim with consequences. Check: Arcana (mind probe) or Presence (menace). Cost: risk 1 Stress or add 1 GM Fear on miss.

### What he likely knows (give 1–2 per success at “Cracked”)

1. Alula Underpaths and Cover Names

- “Ask for shade-tea at the Sump Lantern. If they bring it cold, you’re among ours. If warm, you walk out.”
- “The ‘Root Sisters’ keep lists. Not names—marks. Look for a willow-scratch on the fourth piling past the Old Net-Market.”  
    Actionable: Sump Lantern inn (under-canopy), willow-scratch message drop near Old Net-Market.

2. Fanewraith Cell Structure in the Region

- “Three hands make a cell: Knife, Root, Shade. I’m a Knife. Roots keep caches. Shades listen and carry whispers.”
- “Our Root in Alula goes by ‘Mirel’. Short braid, scar at lip. If I vanish, she burns the cache and moves.”  
    Actionable: Find Mirel (alias), look for lip scar, trace burned cache sites.

3. Cache Clues (the good kind)

- “Black-vine bundles tied with red reed. We coil left for decoys, right for true. Don’t mix them.”
- “Ciphers change each Nightveil. Today’s turn is ‘owl, branch, fall’—if you’re a day late, it’s dust in your mouth.”  
    Actionable: Right-coil=real; cipher-key ‘owl-branch-fall’ valid until Nightveil.

4. The Rite Window (partial)

- “The Turning Gaze needs a crowd, eyes turned upward. Easiest prayers to rob are the loud ones. Ask your priest how often they count the stars.”
- “The Sowing Eye is taken in hope—where hope runs hottest.”  
    Actionable: Expect the Rite in a public/communal observance zone in/near Alula; shrines that gather large crowds.

5. Fanewraith Identity and Motive (tainted truths)

- “Elara Voss mourns in motion. She wears masks so grief can breathe. She doesn’t steal—she returns what was taken.”
- “She hates vaults. She listens where roots remember.”  
    Actionable: She targets symbols/places of hoarded power; likely uses root-remembering sites (ancient groves, old weirs, root-shrines) as staging.

6. Veilshade Rumor (careful nudge)

- “In Haven, dust speaks with many tongues. Some want equality in ash; some want only ash.”
- “If your banners fall, it won’t be to blades—it’ll be to ledgers and whispers.”  
    Actionable: Expect propaganda, sabotage, and supply manipulation rather than open battles; warns PCs to watch their logistics.

7. Route Hazard into Alula

- “Avoid the white-bloom causeway when the reeds sing. That’s when the water hunts sideways.”
- “If you must cross, drop copper. Old debt buys a foot of safe ground.”  
    Actionable: Environmental hazard foreshadowing; coin offering calms a fen-spirit crossing.

8. A Personal Hook (choose one PC to hit)

- Sabriel: “Your red serpent scares beggars, not zealots. But there’s a veteran at the Lantern who still salutes the old way. Ask for ‘Stoneback’. He owes one life.”
- Snicket: “Tell Delilah: the last parcel went to ‘Mr. Tilde’ three nights ago. He didn’t pay in coin.” (Suggests barter/info; ties to earlier delivery thread.)
- Fianna: “A halfling asked after an owl that does not sleep. He left bread where the roots meet the stairs.”  
    Actionable: Each is a meeting/contact lead in Alula with a code phrase.

### How much pushback to give (tone dial)

- Early: Calm stonewall; answers with riddles, generalities; corrects PCs’ wrong assumptions without adding detail.
- Mid: If pressed well, gives procedural details (signals, places) but never names that break another cell.
- Late: Under real leverage or credible threat of being handed to Haven torturers, he will give a true, limited next step (Sump Lantern, Mirel alias, cache tells) and one “warning that saves a life” (hazard tip).
- Hard lines he won’t cross:
    - Fanewraith’s current location
    - Exact Rite timing
    - Names that burn a fellow Knife/Shade (except Mirel alias if you push very hard and promise terms)

#### Escalation triggers (use 1–2 if PCs flounder or you want tension)

- Bite-the-capsule attempt: He tries to crack a poisoned tooth. On a quick Instinct/Agility save by a nearby PC, you stop it; otherwise he becomes woozy (no death per safety rules) and slurs false clues (you can flag them as dubious with a tell).
- Wither flare: His wrist-wrap’s black fibers pulse; on touch, a PC must save (Instinct) or gain 1 Fear; describe a crawling-root sensation under the skin.
- False lead test: He gives two marks: one decoy, one real; Snicket can tell which is genuine by smuggler-code (right coil/left coil clue).

#### Concessions and Deals (ways to close)

- “Sanctuary Oath”: Promise he won’t be turned over to Haven torturers; he yields the Sump Lantern signal and cache-coil truth.
- “Message to Roots”: Let him speak a brief coded line you transcribe (Fern/Fianna can sense if the words carry harm); in return he gives Mirel’s alias and the willow-scratch drop.
- “Field Mercy”: You bind his wounds properly and allow a dignified treatment; he offers the hazard tip (white-bloom causeway and copper) and one personal hook.
- “Soldier’s Pact” (Sabriel): If Sabriel swears Mathias will be guarded during Nightveil, the Knife warns about the public Rite angle (“loud prayers”) and points at which shrines draw crowds.

#### Truth vs. Lie Table

- On a 1–2: Deflecting aphorism; no info.
- 3–4: True but vague (theme-level clue).
- 5: Actionable procedural detail (signal, cache tell, rendezvous).
- 6: Actionable + personal hook.

#### Consequences dial

- Respect earned: He nods at Fern/Fianna and whispers, “Balance isn’t a blade.” Future Fanewraith grunt will hesitate to strike first.
- Grudge set: If threatened with Haven torture, a future cell treats PCs as priority targets.
- Tag planted: He secretly leaves a root-mark on their rope; later, a Shade may track them—Foreshadow with a DC 12 Instinct check to notice.

#### Fear Usage during Interrogation (pick 1–2 as needed)

- Low: The serpent coin on his belt warms; anyone touching it marks 1 temporary Hesitant. Fear feels like a weight behind the eyes.
- Medium: His words carry Dustveil cadence; a PC hears a loved one’s voice layered under his. Disadvantage on next empathy check unless they center themselves.
- High: Brief vision flash—crowd under boughs staring upward, a star winks out. PCs mark 1 Fear unless they reject the omen (Presence save).

#### Two short RP buttons to punctuate

- If they show competence:
    - “You’re not butchers. Good. Look for right-coiled reed at the Old Net-Market. If it’s gone, you’re already late.”
- If they posture:
    - “You cannot guard every prayer. That’s why Eyes should not be caged.”

##### If they knock him out or refuse to interrogate

- He carries:
    - 1 serpent-coin (serpent biting tail, faint oil smell)
    - 1 fanewoven wrist-wrap (black vine fiber; identify to learn it resonates near Wither caches)
    - Scraped willow bark with three tiny notches (cipher turn hint: owl-branch-fall)
- A tucked scrap map: a crude under-canopy sketch, “S.L.” and a willow symbol near a boardwalk.

Handing to Valerius (if they skip deep RP)

- Valerius can extract: “Sump Lantern code; right-coil means real,” and “Mirel alias.” He withholds the personal hook unless a PC advocates.

How to keep mystery intact

- Give routes, signals, and minor aliases.
- Keep Elara Voss/Fanewraith personally off-stage.
- Keep Rite timing partial; emphasize public prayer crowds.
- Tease Dustveil as logistics/supply threat, not faces.

## **Scene 2 – Return to Monks Eliegh**

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
Monks Eliegh's streets stand silent under the afternoon sun, the stone statues of its former inhabitants casting long shadows, their hands clasped in eternal prayer. The chapel doors creak open, and Mathias Vanta steps out—gaunt and robed, his eyes kind but shadowed by his isolation. He spots your group, prisoner in tow, and offers a faint smile: "You return sooner than expected. The stone holds, but the shadows grow long."

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Sunlit statues with weathered features, Mathias' patched robes, faint candle glow from chapel.
- **Sound:** Wind through empty streets, Mathias' soft footsteps, distant creak of chapel door.
- **Smell:** Dry dust, incense, faint musty stone.
- **Touch:** Warm sun on skin, rough stone underfoot, Mathias' frail handshake.
- **Taste:** Chalky air, lingering dryness from travel.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- RP with Mathias: He offers shelter, shares sparse supplies, and listens to your Weir tale.
- Armor repair: Sabriel can use chapel tools for a basic fix (Agility or Knowledge check to restore 1-2 slots).
- Prisoner handling: Secure him in a side room, prompting ethics talk.

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Mathias mentions faint Nikta omens (e.g., unusual owl sightings), tying to Fianna's father and the Sowing Eye.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend Fear to make a statue's eyes glint unnaturally, imposing a brief Hesitant condition; gaining Fear feels like lingering guilt, as if the stone accuses.
- **Medium:** Spend Fear to have whispers echo from statues, revealing a minor plot hint but forcing a Will save vs. Fear; gaining Fear feels like heavy isolation, the town's silence pressing in.
- **High:** Spend Fear to animate a statue briefly (illusory), targeting a PC for light psychic damage; gaining Fear feels like petrifying dread, limbs growing heavy.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** Fern, sensing the town's imbalance through your network—what twisted energies do you detect? (Prompt a Hedge Witch insight or Instinct check.)
- **Fianna:** Fianna, these statues evoke Nikta's cycles—what prayer or omen comes to mind? (Prompt a Druidic ritual or Presence check.)
- **Gnirth:** Gnirth, the stone voids here stir your amnesia—how do you reach out? (Prompt a Sorcerer water-sense or Arcana check.)
- **Sabriel:** Sabriel, protecting Mathias feels like atonement—what do you confide in him? (Prompt a Knight resolve or Presence check.)
- **Snicket:** Snicket, you notice hidden marks on statues—how would you interpret them? (Prompt a Rogue stealth or Finesse check.)

**NPC: Mathias Vanta**

- **Appearance:** Gaunt, elderly human in patched robes, cracked hands from stone-tending.
- **Voice:** Soft, weary, measured—like a gentle wind through reeds.
- **Personality:** Compassionate, haunted, devoted; avoids conflict but offers quiet wisdom.
- **Soundbites:** "The stone remembers, even if we forget." / "Your burdens are heavy—share them, if only for a moment."

**GM Options / Variations:**

- If party pushes urgency: Mathias suggests he travel to Haven for safety, freeing Sabriel.
- Variation A (Social Focus): Deepen RP with shared stories around a fire.
- Variation B (Horror Focus): Prisoner attempts a tainted escape, adding tension.

**Transition Line:**  
With gear mended and Mathias addressed, the group presses on to the barracks, prisoner in tow, as daylight wanes.

---

## **Scene 3 – Detour to the Barracks**

>[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
The squat barracks rise on the horizon, recruits drilling under Valerius' bark. Smoke curls from the mess hall, a brief haven before the road ahead.

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The border barracks emerge from the fen haze, its stone walls patched with timber, Haven banners fluttering limply. Recruits drill in the yard, wooden pikes clashing under the dwarf Valerius D'sousza's thunderous commands: "Block or bleed!" Smoke rises from the mess hall, carrying scents of thin stew, while the prisoner's bonds chafe as you approach, his fate now in military hands.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Faded banners, sweating recruits, Valerius' scarred armor.
- **Sound:** Clatter of drills, Valerius' shouts, muffled prisoner protests.
- **Smell:** Sweat, smoke, oily metal.
- **Touch:** Muddy ground, rough barracks walls, tension in the air.
- **Taste:** Bitter ale from shared canteens, dusty fatigue.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- Hand over prisoner: Valerius interrogates briefly, securing him in cells.
- Gather intel: Ask about Alula routes, Fanewraith rumors (reveals veiled threats).
- Stock up: Minor resupply (rations, minor potions) via barter or Presence checks.

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Valerius mentions upticks in Wither attacks near Alula, linking to Veilshade cells.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend Fear to have a recruit whisper grim rumors, adding Vulnerable to one PC; gaining Fear feels like rising unease, whispers echoing doubts.
- **Medium:** Spend Fear to reveal prisoner's taint spreading to a guard, forcing a quick quarantine roll; gaining Fear feels like contagious worry, skin itching.
- **High:** Spend Fear to trigger a minor breakout attempt, spawning a brief skirmish; gaining Fear feels like chaotic alarm, heart pounding.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** Fern, the barracks' imbalance grates on your senses—what do you sense in the recruits? (Prompt a Hedge Witch network check.)
- **Fianna:** Fianna, these soldiers remind you of Haven's invasions—what do you challenge Valerius on? (Prompt a Druidic persuasion or Presence check.)
- **Gnirth:** Gnirth, the prisoner's mind voids call to you—how do you extract one last secret? (Prompt a Sorcerer probe or Arcana check.)
- **Sabriel:** Sabriel, as an old ally, what favor do you ask Valerius for Mathias? (Prompt a Knight leadership or Strength check.)
- **Snicket:** Snicket, you spot smuggling marks in the barracks—how do you exploit them? (Prompt a Rogue finesse or Investigation check.)

**NPC: Valerius D'sousza**

- **Appearance:** Stout dwarf, scarred face, battered armor missing pauldron.
- **Voice:** Gruff, booming, like gravel under boots.
- **Personality:** Hardass drillmaster, loyal to Haven, grumbles but respects old friends.
- **Soundbites:** "What in the fens have you dragged in now?" / "Train hard or die soft—that's the way."

**GM Options / Variations:**

- If party skips: Prisoner handled off-screen via messenger, freeing time for Alula push.
- Variation A (Social Focus): Extend with training montage RP.
- Variation B (Horror Focus): Prisoner reveals a taint vision before passing out.

**Transition Line:**  
Prisoner secured and intel gained, the party faces the crossroads, Nightveil's shadow drawing near.

---

## **Scene 4 – Crossroads Decision**

[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
At the fen's fork, Kreil's map unfurls under fading light. Paths diverge—to Alula now, or wait out the dark?

[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The fen path forks under the late afternoon sun, reeds whispering as wind picks up. Kreil's map lies open, marking hidden routes to Alula—5-7 days away, with Nightveil just 4 days off. Your wounds ache, armor patched but fragile, as the group debates: push into gathering shadows for speed, or hole up and risk delay? The air thickens, decisions weighing like the coming twilight.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Forking paths, map's faded ink, lengthening shadows.
- **Sound:** Whispering reeds, group's murmurs, distant wildlife.
- **Smell:** Damp earth, approaching mist.
- **Touch:** Cooling breeze, map's rough parchment.
- **Taste:** Uncertainty's tang, like stale water.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- Group debate: RP tensions between Fianna's urgency and Sabriel's caution.
- Map consult: Reveals a minor shortcut, but with risks (e.g., tainted zones).
- Final prep: Last-minute decisions on travel during Nightveil vs. waiting a week.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend Fear to add a ominous omen (e.g., black-veined flower), imposing Hesitant; gaining Fear feels like subtle dread, paths blurring.
- **Medium:** Spend Fear to force a group Will save vs. doubt, revealing a false map flaw; gaining Fear feels like divisive suspicion, allies seeming distant.
- **High:** Spend Fear to manifest a brief illusion of pursuit, escalating to a chase setup; gaining Fear feels like urgent panic, time slipping away.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** Fern, the map's lines pulse through your network—what imbalances do you foresee? (Prompt a Hedge Witch foresight check.)
- **Fianna:** Fianna, your father's trail burns urgent—what do you urge the group? (Prompt a Druidic motivation or Presence check.)
- **Gnirth:** Gnirth, water in the fen responds to your mood—how does it guide the choice? (Prompt a Sorcerer elemental sense or Arcana check.)
- **Sabriel:** Sabriel, balancing protection and duty—what compromise do you propose? (Prompt a Knight strategy or Presence check.)
- **Snicket:** Snicket, spotting hidden dangers on the map—how do you scout ahead? (Prompt a Rogue stealth or Finesse check.)

**GM Options / Variations:**

- Signpost: Warn that Nightveil travel risks encounters but saves time; waiting builds GM Fear but allows full rest.
- Variation A (Social Focus): Deepen with personal backstory shares.
- Variation B (Horror Focus): Add a minor taint sighting to heighten stakes.

---

## **End-of-Session Hooks & Choices**

1. **Push to Alula Immediately:** Travel through early Nightveil for speed, risking horrors but reaching Fianna's father sooner (sparks urgency, potential encounters).
2. **Wait Out Nightveil:** Hole up at barracks or Monks Eliegh for a week, repairing fully but letting GM stockpile Fear (allows recovery, builds tension).
3. **Hybrid Path:** Send a message to Mathias via recruit, then take a map shortcut to Alula, balancing risks (prompts compromise RP).
