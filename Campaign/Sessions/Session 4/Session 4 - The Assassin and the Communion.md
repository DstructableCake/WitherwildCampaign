# **Daggerheart – Session 4 Notes**

**Title:** _Echoes of the Weir_  
**Theme:** Recovery amid urgency, fragile alliances, and the pull of personal quests as Nightveil looms.  
**Setting:** The aftermath of the ambush at the Old Weir, journeys back through the fen, and preparations for Alula.

## Interrogation at the Weir

The session opened in the dim, dust - choked cave of the Old Weir. Dust still hung in the air from the collapse, catching the light in slow - falling motes. The hogtied prisoner - an Inferni zealot - glared with defiance, faint black veins pulsing beneath his skin. Outside, the fen hummed with life, the metallic tang of blood mixed with the smell of charred stone.

As the party deliberated on what to do, the prisoner addressed Fern, Fianna, and Gnirth directly. His whispering voice carried an unsettling calm as he told them they were “unlike the others,” and questioned why nature - bound souls would ally with Haven’s soldiers. That taunt coaxed the group toward interrogation - but the balance of information skewed fast. The zealot seemed to learn more about them than they did about him, using their questions to read their motives.

Gnirth tried intimidation. He produced a jar of Witherwild tar whose oily surface shimmered like a bruise, letting its threat speak for him. The Inferni did not flinch. Sabriel pressed for the barracks - let Valerius handle it properly - yet the prisoner’s eyes lit with a spark that felt wrong, as if the idea of Haven’s cells suited him. Doubt rippled through the group.

## Contacting Tybella via the Fungril Network

With tensions rising, Fern and Gnirth linked into the Fungril network. Threads of unseen connection stretched out through soil and root toward the barracks kitchens. A faint hum pricked the skin; the air smelled suddenly of damp earth and spores.

Tybella answered. She confirmed no expected visitors beyond new recruits - most already rerouted to Haven. Together, the three spoke openly: where the party was, who was present, and the plan to move on toward Alula after resolving the prisoner.

When Fern and Gnirth tried to pull back, the link did not release cleanly. It tugged. Tybella seemed to linger a heartbeat too long before fading. Gnirth felt it first - a chill certainty that the channel was not secure. Someone could have been listening.

## The Prisoner’s Suicide Attempt

Even as the communion faded, Sabriel noticed the prisoner working his jaw strangely - tongue searching the back of his mouth. His face tightened with a grim resolve.

Acting on instinct, Sabriel forced the assassin’s mouth open. Snicket slipped in like a shadow and plucked out the hidden object: a poisoned false tooth. The Inferni had chosen death over capture. Whatever confidence he’d feigned about the barracks had been a mask - he had never meant to arrive alive.

They bound him more tightly. Snicket palmed the tooth. The cave swallowed the last of the scuffle’s echoes.

## Splitting the Party and Travel

Nightveil loomed only days away. There wasn’t time to ferry the prisoner to Monks Eliegh, then to the barracks, and return again. The party split.

Fianna took horse shape and bore the prisoner with Sabriel riding guard. The pace was brutal; Fianna pushed through the strain, her breath fogging in short, sharp bursts. They made the barracks without incident and requested a private meeting with Valerius.

Behind closed doors, Sabriel shared Kreil’s revelations - Fanewraith’s plan to take the Sowing Eye, the ambush, the assassin’s fanatic resolve. Valerius, strapped for resources with recruit rotations, still found a way to help: he supplied armor repair kits, one per party member. On a long rest, each kit could be used to upgrade an armor piece to Tier 2; single - use.

They asked about Tybella. Valerius snorted that he hoped she could be trusted - she was feeding his troops - and confirmed she had already prepared a cell. With that, Sabriel and Fianna began the return to Monks Eliegh. The road, mercifully, stayed quiet.

Meanwhile, Fern, Snicket, and Gnirth retraced the trail back to Monks Eliegh on foot. Without Sabriel, they traveled alert and careful, letting silence and the fen’s small noises fill the gaps between them.

## Journey Back to Monks Eliegh (Fern, Snicket, Gnirth)

Midway, the trio discovered a cairn by the roadside - new, precariously balanced, with a single stone missing from the top. Fern searched the brush and found a perfect match: smooth, cool, and just the right weight.

As she set it in place, the stack vibrated with a low, resonant hum. Stones tumbled and rolled, not collapsing, but reforming - clicking into a new shape with a forward roll that ended in a seated, rocky figure.

Fulg, Stacker of Stones, regarded them with patient calm.

He thanked Fern for restoring balance. His voice - like a gravel slide - spoke of the careful equilibrium of the world and how the Witherwild had thrown its steps into chaos. He did not fix blame; he only named imbalance. Coordinated action, he warned, could so easily become disorder. He would not push the scales further.

Asked about other faint divinities, Fulg spoke of Ikla the Sky Painter, tired of painting the same spring sky over and over. Of Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom, whom Ikla favored. Of Bolgin, long silent, now impossible to reach. He admitted he wandered away from many waters; the rivers felt tainted. Perhaps connected to Bolgin, though he would not speculate.

Snicket balked at the sight - skeptical, disbelieving. Gnirth tried to lance Fulg with an insult - only to be calmly named “no different than a flower,” a line that struck deeper than expected.

Fulg offered what aid he could: not action, not advice, but guidance. Follow the cairns if you become lost.

The road beyond remained uneventful, and the trio pressed on.

## Reunion and Long Rest

By evening, the group reconvened in Monks Eliegh’s chapel. Statue - shadows reached across the floor; Mathias’ candle burned with its steady flame.

They exchanged news. The prisoner was secured. Repair kits had been procured. Nightveil crept closer. With the road to Alula ahead, they chose a long rest - mending armor, quieting breath, steadying hands.

Dust settled. The air held the dry, clean scent of stone and wax.

## Fern’s Communion During Long Rest

Fern drew her circle with care. She reached, not outward, but downward - into the memory of Bolgin, into the moment after Sabriel cut him down.

The first sensation was taste. Gasoline - sharp, suffocating - poured over her skin and down her throat. She gagged and coughed thick tar that clung like a second tongue.

The second sensation came with earth. Bitter, mossy bile crept up and stuck to her skin, a slick, gritty coating that would not wash away.

The third sensation dragged her under. She fell into a black ocean of tar, swimming through treacle beneath a sky she did not recognize. Strange stars burned and moved in auroral currents - alive, restless, beautiful.

A small island broke the horizon. Fern crawled onto its shore, lungs burning, and saw a toad perched on the ridge. Its eyes were deep wells - black holes drinking the sky. She felt the draw before she understood it. Then the world seized her - and ripped her free of her body.

The voice came from everywhere: vast, cold, and absolute. "WHO DARES SUMMON ME".

Fern tried to speak. She tried to say she was there for balance, for answers, to stop the Witherwild’s spread. The voice cut through her plea.

"YOU CANNOT STOP WHAT IS HAPPENING, NOR WHAT IS COMING. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SET IN MOTION. I WILL RETURN AND SHOW THE SO - CALLED GOD KILLERS HOW MORTAL THEY REALLY ARE".

The universe pressed down. The island shattered into light. Fern’s consciousness slammed back into her body. Her eyes rolled white; black tar bled from her mouth and eyes. The summoning circle broke.

Then - silence. The chapel, the candle, the stone figures watching. Fern collapsed, unconscious, the echo of that voice lingering like a bruise on the air.
