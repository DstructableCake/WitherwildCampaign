# Daggerheart – Session 6 Notes

**Title:** _The Siege of Serpents Hope_ - Part 1 
**Theme:** Converging threats, impossible choices, and the price of protection—dawn breaks over fields of white, and shadows gather in the morning light.  
**Setting:** Low Passage Night Market at Nightveil's end, through secret passages into the early dawn of Sunnar, arriving at Serpents Hope farms as coordinated assault begins—a three-pronged attack that tests the party's ability to defend everything at once.

## Market Departure & Haven's Warnings

The party pressed deeper into Low Passage's night market, the air still thick with the murmur of muffled barters and the glow of bloom-lanterns swaying overhead. Stalls of woven reed stood arrayed like sentinels in the cavernous root-hall, their wares catching the flickering light as the group searched for items of interest among the Nightveil merchants.

Fern found herself drawn to Mira the Herbalist's stall, where bundles of dried herbs hung like offerings and the earthy scent of knowledge filled the air. She inquired about books on local flora and fauna, but stock was thin—the market's offerings had been depleted by the constant demand for survival knowledge. Yet when Fern mentioned a Fungril at the barracks, Mira's eyes lit with recognition. In exchange for that information, she produced a small bundle of notes—handwritten pages detailing the local plant life, carefully annotated with warnings about what was dangerous to avoid and what could be safely harvested. The pages felt warm, as if they carried the wisdom of someone who had learned these lessons firsthand.

Sabriel, meanwhile, found himself hailed by an unexpected courier—a pygmy monkey bearing two sealed notes that gleamed with Haven's official seal. The creature's small hands were deft as it passed the missives, its dark eyes meeting Sabriel's for a moment before it vanished back into the market's shadows.
>[!Quote] A.S
>*Arden -*
>
*Your report confirms our worst fears. The corruption spreads faster than we anticipated. I've seen the patrol reports - creatures that shouldn't exist, growing larger with each encounter. The research division is working around the clock, but I fear we're fighting shadows.*
>
*Additional patrols have been deployed, but they're stretched thin. The men are nervous, and I don't blame them. Something is stirring in the deep places, and it's watching us.*
>
*Keep your eyes open, and trust no one outside our circle.*
>
*P.S. - Burn this after reading.*

>[!Quote] V.D
>*This changes everything. I've read your report three times, and each time it chills me more. Fanewraith... Elara Voss... I remember her from the old days. A healer, gentle with children. To think she's become this.*
>
*The Eye theft is catastrophic. Phylax is beside himself - the wards around the Sowing Eye have been tripled, but I fear it may not be enough. The Rite approaches, and the timing is too perfect to be coincidence.*
>
*Stay safe, old friend. The storm is coming.*
>
*P.S. - The assassin you captured... he's been... cooperative. More than I expected.*

The notes weighed heavy in Sabriel's hands. Breaking the first seal, Ambrose Salecia's words unfolded like a confession of desperation—the corruption spreading faster than anticipated, patrol reports speaking of creatures growing larger with each encounter, the research division fighting shadows. The men were nervous. Something stirred in the deep places, watching.

The second letter came from Valerius D'sousza, and its contents chilled Sabriel more deeply. Fanewraith... Elara Voss... remembered from gentler days, now transformed. The Eye theft was catastrophic. Phylax had tripled the wards, but it might not be enough. The Rite approached, and the timing was too perfect to be coincidence. The assassin had been cooperative—too cooperative, perhaps.

A deep bell tolled through the market's din, ringing like a bear's growl given voice. The large orcish shadow overseeing the trade rose to full height, his voice booming through the cavern as he called last orders. The market's pulse shifted, merchants beginning to shutter their stalls, lanterns dimming one by one. The party left soon after, the weight of Haven's warnings heavy in their packs.

## Secret Passage Through Nightveil's End

Snicket guided them through the rest of the passage system—a maze of twisting caves and dead ends, each turn marked by sigils that only she could recognize. The air grew cool and damp, the sound of dripping water echoing like whispers in the dark. Time blurred in the underground labyrinth, measured only by the rhythm of their footsteps and the gradual lightening of the tunnel ahead.

They reached the lower entrance to the passage system, hidden behind the deep, gnarled roots of a massive tree that resembled a mangrove in the way its roots formed a natural archway. The roots twisted and interlocked like ancient fingers, creating a curtain of shadow that concealed the exit from casual eyes. Careful to cover their trail, the party emerged one by one, streaming out into a dense forest where the air tasted different—fresher, tinged with the promise of dawn.

The sky above showed the first signs of Sunnar breaking through Nightveil's endless starry veil. A light gradient painted the horizon, bleeding from deep purples and indigos into vibrant oranges and golds. The transition felt like watching the world wake from a long dream, colors intensifying with each passing moment as the perpetual dusk finally surrendered to daylight.

## Fulg's Message Among the Stones

Further along the trail, as dawn's light filtered through the canopy above, the Fanewick residents noticed a small pile of rocks to the side of the road—unremarkable at first glance, but something about their arrangement felt intentional. Assuming it to be a sign of Fulg, Fern knelt and quickly attempted to rebuild them into a proper cairn, her hands moving with the instinct of someone who understood balance.

The stones showed no immediate effect, but as Fern worked, her fingers brushed against one rock that was not like the others—darker in color, slick with moisture that had gathered in the night. Its surface felt smooth and deliberate beneath her touch. Leaning on the rule that all things must be balanced, Fianna stepped forward and called upon her magic, warmth spreading from her palms as she dried the rock. The moisture evaporated in soft wisps of steam, and as the last drop vanished, something shifted.

The small pile of stones began to vibrate with a low, resonant hum. Stones tumbled and rolled, not collapsing, but reforming—clicking into place with a forward motion that ended in a seated, rocky figure. Fulg, Stacker of Stones, regarded them with patient calm, his stony form settling into a comfortable position at the roadside.

More friendly in nature than their previous encounters, he introduced himself to the other members of the group—something Sabriel would later dismiss as inconsequential, but which carried weight for those who understood divinities. Fulg admitted he had not seen these companions before, and there was a note of curiosity in his gravel-slide voice.

He revealed he had been asked to deliver a note that was destined for them but had not made its way correctly. His stony hands moved with surprising delicacy as he cracked open the once-wet rock, which split cleanly to reveal a scroll nestled within, its surface bearing Haven's familiar seal.
>[!Quote] Intilligence Division
>*Command -*
>
*The situation is more dire than we initially assessed. The interrogation has revealed a network deeper than we imagined. Fanewraith's reach extends into our own ranks - I've seen the serpent coins, heard the whispers. The coin is used as a marker of those within their ranks*
>
*The farms are indeed a target, but not the only one. The operation is coordinated, sophisticated. They've been planning this for weeks, maybe months. The timing is no accident - they know our weaknesses.*
>
*I recommend immediate action:*
*- Double the guard at all agricultural facilities*
*- Deploy additional forces to the Veil Farms - they're vulnerable*
*- Root out the network cells before they strike*
>
*The assassin was... eager to talk. Too eager. I suspect he's telling us what they want us to know. The real threat may be elsewhere.*
>
*P.S. - Watch your back. Trust no one.*

Once delivered and after exchanging pleasantries—including praise for finding his markers—Fulg wished the party well and then, with the same gentle motion, fell back into a small pile of rocks. The stones settled into place as if he had never been there, save for the scroll now in their possession and the memory of his kind words.

## Elowen's Hospitality at Dawn

Further on the trail, as the first true rays of Sunnar pierced the forest canopy, a sweet and herby smell filled the surrounding area. To Fianna, Fern, and Gnirth, it carried a familiar comfort—something that smelled like home, like memories of going to grandma's for a home-cooked meal. The aroma led them to a small clearing where an elderly woman tended a cookfire, the flames casting warm light against the morning's chill.

![[Elowen Portrait.png|300]]

She introduced herself as Elowen, her voice kind and her movements deliberate. Alongside her, a mole named Demetrius moved with quiet purpose, his dark fur catching the firelight. She invited the party to sit and eat, insisting they must have been traveling for a long time through the night. The invitation felt genuine, unburdened by suspicion or expectation.

As conversation flowed, she explained she came from a village a long way from here, close to Alula, drawn from her love for nature. Her perspective on the tainted creatures was gentle—she did not see them as something to worry about, as she loved all animals and creatures with equal measure. Her "pet" mole had been raised from birth, but he had been very sickly. She had nursed him back to health with patient care, and since then, he had stayed by her side, his keen senses guiding her through the dark of Nightveil when her own eyes failed.

Fianna and Fern responded with warmth, their voices soft and appreciative. Gnirth focused on the food with single-minded determination, clearing plate after plate with the enthusiasm of someone who understood the value of a good meal. All gave their names freely—Sabriel included, though with more caution. Fianna, hope threading through her words, asked about her father [[Theodore Underbrush|Theodore]]—had Elowen seen him on her travels?

Elowen's eyes lit with recognition. Yes, she had seen a friendly music player a few days back, passing by the nearest farm of Serpents Hope. He had been very kind, she recalled, and a good storyteller. The description matched, and Fianna's shoulders relaxed slightly at the news.

After eating and exchanging farewells, the party departed as the first full light of Sunnar reached into the brisk morning air. The path widened, and soon they reached the edge of a cliff that overlooked a breathtaking vista below. White flowers stretched as far as the eye could see—a sea of pale blossoms that rippled gently in the morning breeze. Small dark motions moved among the fields, workers cultivating the flowers with practiced hands. Patches of red interspersed the white, creating a pattern that felt both beautiful and intentional. It didn't take long for the party to descend and reach the gates of the farms.

## Arrival at Serpents Hope

The farm itself sprawled across the landscape, a testament to organized industry. A central roadway split the complex, separating the working fields from the living quarters. To the south of this road, near two large warehouses, areas for unloading and loading had been cleared and organized with military precision. The warehouses loomed like sentinels, their walls thick and their doors reinforced. To the north, several large tents and canopies created pockets of shade and shelter, and beyond them lay many small houses and dwellings—homes for the workers and their families, nestled together like a small village within the farm's boundaries.

"Hey, You!" came a cry from the watchtower, sharp and commanding. "Get back to work!"

They had been mistaken for merchants or workers. Sabriel reacted quickly, decloaking to reveal his armor set, the Haven insignia catching the morning light. After a quick explanation that they had come to deliver warnings, the party was directed to the main tent perched on a small hill situated between the storage warehouses and the living quarters.

Walking through the farms, a troubling realization settled over the group. Guard resources were thin—dangerously so. Only a couple dozen guards were visible across the entire estate. A couple stood watch outside the warehouses, several more patrolled around the barracks and tents, and the rest kept watch over the fields. For an operation this size, the protection felt inadequate, like trying to hold back a flood with only a few sandbags. The weight of Haven's warnings grew heavier.

## The Warning & Quartermaster Brill

On reaching the main tent, Sabriel hailed down the local commander [[Quartermaster Brill]] inside, where maps were spread across tables and guards stood in tense clusters. Sabriel informed him of the news received from Haven, the warnings from the assassin's interrogation, and the dire truth—the farms were in danger. Initially, there was wariness about sharing such sensitive information in front of the other guards, the atmosphere in the tent growing thick with suspicion.

Snicket had an idea. She began playing with the stolen serpent coin in front of the other guards inside the tent, watching their faces carefully for any sign of recognition, any flicker of complicity. But there was no reaction other than confusion—blank stares and puzzled expressions. Either the guards were innocent, or the infiltration ran deeper than a simple tell could reveal.

Gnirth, Fianna, and Fern didn't wait around in the tent. Gnirth headed out to the farms to investigate, his keen eyes scanning for signs of trouble. Fianna and Fern made their way to the warehouses to inquire about the flowers, their curiosity genuine. They attempted to convince the guards to let them take one of the white flowers, explaining they were set to be destroyed anyway. The guards refused to let them handle the flowers directly, but one guard offered to retrieve one himself, disappearing into the warehouse's depths.

It was in that moment—as the guard vanished behind the warehouse doors, as the party stood scattered across the farm, as Quartermaster Brill absorbed Sabriel's warning—that the assault began.
u- A lot happened quickly. Hoards of movement were seen towards the tree lines, with guards holding off the initial wave around the outskirts of the farm. Meanwhile, some smaller and move focussed immediate threats revealed themselves closer to the farms:
	- The farms found themselves clouded in dust, shining like light through diamonds in the morning sun. Towards the east a swarm of Glasswing Moths were kicking up dust and obscurring the actions of an Earthrend Molebeast, its identity given away by the earthly movements.
	- The warehouses found themselves being attacked by familiar foe - Bloodwings - accompanied by a Wither Touched Stag. The stag was clearly attempting to destroy the warehouse containing the [[Lady's Veil]] flowers.
	- Finally, and most dangerous of all, were 3 Flameburst Fireflys being lead by a Briarback Boar towards the camps of workers and civillians. There were some buildings already on fire, with families and workers panicked and trying to escape.
- It was clear that there was not enough cover to deal with all 3 threats. The decision was made that Fern and Fianna would focus on the warehouses full of flowers, whilst the rest would focus on saving the innocents and get them away from the fire spewing beasts. The fields would tend to themselves.
- What followed was a manic back and forth in **battle**.
	- Sabriel leapt into battle against the fireflies, damaging the beasts each, while the boar shrugged off the attack.
	- Gnirth helped out also, attempting to sear the bugs with his flaming hands, but found out quickly this would have little effect on the creatures, doing minimal damage, and powering up their attacks.
	- Snicket and Sabriel initiated a tag team attack on the bugs, who continued to send fire and explosions the way of the civilians. Doing so, they discovered the bugs go out with an explosive end, sending flaming guts to everything close - Sabriel and Gnirth feeling the heat.
	- Moving over to the warehouses, Fern and Fiana attempted to deal with the Bloodwings and the Stag while the guards tried to clear as much of the Ladys Veil flowers as they could.
	- The bloodwings proved illusive, managing to dodge attacks and bait the party members while the stag dealt damage not to them, but the warehouse above the stockpile. 3 Walls were managed to break through with little resistance.
	- All the while, the fields were going unguarded. The Glasswing Moths were shielding the fields in dust and rainbow particles, while what the party assumed was a Molebeast was tearing through the fields, rendering them unusable. This progressed across 3 fields and continued its wrath while the party were distracted.
- The session ended there, half way through the battle, party doing well to quell the damage to lives but the destruction of the farms and warehouses are taking its toll.
- To be continued next time.
