Title: The Siege of Serpents Hope: Part 1
Theme: Fragile truces, masks and motives, the cost of plenty  
Setting: Nightveil exits [[Low Passage]] into Haven-occupied [[Fanewick]]. The party closes out the Night Market, meets a kindly traveler at a roadside fire ([[Fanewraith]] in disguise), then reaches the [[Crimson Lady's Veil Farms]] where tensions, toil, and sabotage erupt.

## Title Card

> [!Quote] Henry David Thoreau
> "The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it."  


## Session Preparation

- Estimated Time: 3–4 hours (Scene 1: 35–45 min; Scene 2: 30–40 min; Scene 3: 45–60 min; Scene 4: 60–70 min)
- Key Ties to Campaign:
    - [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]'s network (Tilde) gets a solid lead in Scene 1.
    - [[Fanewraith]] (Elowen) appears in Scene 2—friendly, probing, deniable.
    - [[Haven]] vs. [[Fanewick]] clash over [[Crimson Lady's Veil Farms]] in Scene 3–4.
    - [[The Rite of the Turning Gaze]] fore-shadowed by sabotage cadence and thorn-omens.
- Player Agency Notes:
    - Scene 1 is open shopping/info RP; Scene 2 is pure social with multiple off-ramps (probe, accept kindness, decline).
    - Scene 3 is hub-style: choose 2–3 small tasks; Alarm Clock tracks escalation.
    - Scene 4 setpiece uses a visible d8 countdown (“Thorn-Tide”) and multi-objectives; success measured in saved lives/resources, not bodycount alone.
- Materials Needed:
    - [[Low Passage]] sketch (runes to market), Farm field zone map (three lanes: clank row, worker lane, storage stacks).
    - Tokens for Clocks: d8 “Thorn-Tide,” d3 “Alarm,” 4-segment “Rite Progress.”
    - SRD stat blocks (Guards) + [Custom] below.
- Safety & Tone:
    - Lines/Veils: no sexual violence; no explicit child harm; body horror suggestive only.
    - Offer Alternatives to Violence: resolution at farms can be aid/evacuate, not only kill.
- Potential [Custom] Content:
    - [[Fanewraith]] Skulker variant, [[Witherwild Root-Whip Hulk]], [[Wither-Stampede Swarm]], [[Clank Harvester]]. All tagged [Custom], tuned conservatively for Tier 2 party.

## Session Flow Map (for Modular Scenes)

- Anchor Beats: Scene 1 (Market wrap), Scene 2 (Traveler fire), Scene 4 (Setpiece battle)
- Modular Scene: Scene 3 (Farms small tasks) can be pruned/expanded; Travel Inserts may interleave as time allows.

### Clocks & Timers (SRD-adjacent pacing aids)

- Nightveil Clock (7): advances 1 per real-time act break; at 4/7 blooms begin over-pulsing (omens); at 7/7 first true dawn-shadow over [[Fanewick]] (cosmetic).
- [[The Rite of the Turning Gaze]] Progress Clock (4): advances when party delays to long-talk/long-rest or ignores thorn omens; at full, [[Fanewraith]]'s next major play moves up-timeline.
- Alarm/Pursuit Clock (3): farms only; advances on failed stealth, loud conflict, or harming noncombatants. At 3/3: local lockdown or patrol surge.
- Thorn-Tide Countdown (d8): set at Scene 3 start; tick down 1 at each completed interaction (task, extended parley, or failed Sneak). At 1: Scene 4 begins (onslaught).

### Fear Economy Plan (SRD: Fear Tokens)

- Start: 2 tokens
- Expected Gains: +2–4 (tense social, farm harms, setpiece horrors)
- Planned Spends:
    - Scene 2: Low—fire flicker omen; Medium—shadows mimic inner doubts.
    - Scene 3: Low—clank glitch; Medium—worker panic spreads; High—siren bloom misleads team.
    - Scene 4: Low—thorn growth; Medium—stampede splits party zones; High—temporary Withered condition on a PC (SRD: Conditions).
- Safety Valve: If Fear ≥ 5, introduce a clear mercy window (evacuation success, allied aid) to stabilize.

## Party Snapshot (Quick Reference)

- [[Fern Wingsteria]] (Fungril Hedge Witch): network/rituals; vision-mark under eyes; balance focus.
- [[Fianna Fernwhisperer]] (Faun Druid of [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]): protect life; father lead ([[Theodore Underbrush]]); Brindle cure drive.
- [[Gnirth]] (Fungril Sorcerer—Water/void): urges & amnesia; void echoes in waterways.
- [[Sabriel Arden]] (Human Guardian Knight): atonement, protect meek; low HP previously; armor kits pending.
- [[Snicket Surefoot]] (Goblin Rogue Nightwalker): smuggling nets, ledger senses; Tilde package.

## Scene Modules Index

- Scenes: 4 total (Social, Social, Exploration/Task Hub [Modular], Combat/Setpiece)
- Travel Inserts provided after scenes for interleaving if pacing requires.

## Scene 1 – Night Market: Closing the Ledger (Modular: No • Scene Type: Social | Exploration)

[[Night Market 2.png]]
[[Night Market.png]]

>[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
Bloom-lanterns sway in the damp air. Runes pulse faintly along the root-walls. Traders lower their voices as Nightveil thins. Last offers. Last secrets. Then the tunnels breathe you out.

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The market's murmur settles into a softer rhythm—stalls lit by hanging blooms, water ticking through struts, slyborne runes winking like tired eyes. Vendors pack crates with practiced hands, but a few linger for final trades: herbs that glow faintly, scrolls that taste of secrets, and ledger pages that can buy you a door no one else sees. Somewhere deeper, a warded chest hums one last time before it sleeps.

Senses:

- Sight: Bloom halos, runes fading, crates stacked like teeth, ward-sigils dimming.
- Sound: Drip…drip; low barters; rope creak; a single chord from a busker far back.
- Smell: Wet stone, herbal smoke, oil on leather.
- Touch: Rope-scarred rails, cool mist on skin, faint static from the chest ward.
- Taste: Bitter herbal tang, metal in the air.

Setting & Immediate Beats:

- Vendors available for final questions and purchases (Mira, Jek, Renn, Tess).
- Strong info-gates: Tilde's trail; safe route to farms; tensions in fields (over-harvest, clank quotas).
- Choice: Stock up, dig for rumor, or slip out now (Thorn-Tide d8 does not advance here unless prolonged haggling).

Player Spotlights:

- Fern: Fungril-to-Fungril with Mira—trade a small rite for a discount or clue about a bloom shrine near the farms (Presence/Instinct).
- Fianna: Ask Tess humane routes through fields to avoid spooking herds (Presence).
- Gnirth: Feel the warded chest hum—do you resist the "deep water" call? (Instinct).
- Sabriel: Swear an oath to protect a named worker group; unlocks aid token later (Presence).
- Snicket: Cross-check ledgers; detect shaved numbers on Veil distribution (Knowledge/Finesse).

GM Notes:

- If RP slows, have Renn offer a "Renn's Route" hand-drawn path (saves half-day, avoid 1 patrol).
- Social Focus: More lore, fewer items; Horror Focus: Runic light dims, wall-veins twitch; Action Focus: Crate falls—minor hazard to clear.
- Transition Line: The runes blink one last time; the market exhales. The tunnels guide you to the light, and somewhere above, the first hints of dawn begin to paint the sky with colors that promise both hope and danger.

## Scene 2 – The Kindly Fire (Modular: No • Scene Type: Social)

[[Elowin Campfire Stew.png]]

>[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
A lonely fire steams herbal broth. An old woman in thorn-stitched robes hums and ladles stew. She gestures to the empty places around the flame. "Eat. Nightveil keeps its own counsel."

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The clearing holds a modest hearth—reeds woven into a windbreak, a stewpot rocking with each soft bubble. The traveler's lined face is half-shadowed beneath her hood, her hands quick and practiced: bowls, spoons, a crust of herb bread wrapped in cloth. Blooms rim the grass, their light pulsing like slow breath. The road unspools east, toward wide fields and a long day, but for now the fire is warm, the stew is kind, and the old woman's eyes are patient.

Senses:

- Sight: Firelight on a weathered face; soft bloom-circles; steam-wisp in Nightveil air.
- Sound: Crackle-pop of kindling; low, familiar hum; distant river hush.
- Smell: Thyme, onion, peat smoke; a clean herbal note.
- Touch: Bowl-warmth; damp reed mats; breath visible in cool air.
- Taste: Savory stew; a faint mint aftertaste.

Setting & Immediate Beats:

- The traveler ("Elowen") asks simple things, offers simple kindness: "Where from? Where headed? Beware of bloom-lures near the herds."
- She volunteers helpful tidbits—safe water, shift-change times, worker paths—if the party engages.
- She steers gently toward Nikta, Alula, and "smugglers with serpent coins" without arousing suspicion.

Entry Triggers:

- Use on first safe campsite after Low Passage exit; ideal before dawn-glow.

Exit Paths / Outcomes:

- Shared meal: Each gains 1d4 temp HP for next scene; +1 on first Presence check with farm workers.
- Exchange of info: Gain a concise, hand-sketched star map (advantage to navigate to farms undetected once).
- Decline food/leave fast: No boon; she simply wishes them a safe road.

Optional Lore Implications:

- Phrases like "Roots keep the oldest songs" and "Eyes should belong to the sky" foreshadow Fanewraith and the Rite without naming them.
- She recognizes a halfling tune if Fianna hums—"Heard that once from a bard on the under-canopy roads…" (Theodore breadcrumb).

Fear Usage (SRD: Fear Tokens):

- Low: Fire gutters; a bloom vein seems to reach—gaining Fear feels like a brief prickle behind the eyes.
- Medium: A shadow crosses the stew; for a heartbeat, the pot reflects each PC's worst doubt—gaining Fear feels like the air turned thin.

Player Spotlights:

- Fern: Read the stew herbs and blooms for omen (Instinct).
- Fianna: Ask about safe paths for herds and healers (Presence).
- Gnirth: Resist the draw in the pot's reflection (Instinct).
- Sabriel: Ask about worker safety/oaths (Presence).
- Snicket: Decode a traveler's cant hidden in her phrasing (Knowledge/Finesse).

GM Notes:

- Social Focus: Let her gift more small truths; Horror Focus: Bloom light feels one degree too bright; Action Focus: A sudden distant stampede tremor foreshadows Scene 4.
- Transition Line: The stew cools, the fire folds to embers, and the road east brightens like a held breath. As you walk, the air grows heavier with the promise of what lies ahead—fields that stretch like wounds, and the distant sound of machinery that grinds against the earth's resistance.

NPCs in this Scene

- **"Elowen" ([[Fanewraith]] in Disguise)**
    - **Appearance:** Thorn-stitched robes, hands steady; a kindly smile. Her face is weathered but kind, with deep-set eyes that seem to hold ancient wisdom. Her movements are graceful and practiced, like someone who has spent years in the wilds.
    - **Voice:** Comfortable rasp, measured; a teacher's cadence. Speaks with the authority of someone who has seen much and learned to be patient with the world's troubles.
    - **Personality:** Patient, generous, keen observer. She listens more than she speaks, asking questions that seem innocent but probe for useful information.
    - **Temperament:** Genuinely helpful but calculating; every kindness serves her greater purpose.
    - **Soundbites:** "Eat first, ask later." / "The sky's eyes prefer to be free." / "Shift-change is the safest crowd to be." / "Roots keep the oldest songs." / "Eyes should belong to the sky." / "Some songs are meant to be heard only by the wind."

        - **Drop subtle hints** - "The earth remembers what was taken from it"
        - **Show concern** - "Be careful who you trust in these times"
        - **Listen intently** - she's gathering intelligence for her cause
    - **Her Goals in This Scene:**
        - **Gauge the party's threat level** - are they enemies or potential allies?

        - **Plant seeds of doubt** - about Haven's methods and motives
        - **Gather intelligence** - about Haven's defenses and weaknesses
        - **Test their knowledge** - do they know about the Eyes, the Rite, her plans?
    - **Subtle Clues (for observant PCs):**
        - Her knowledge of the area seems too detailed for a simple traveler
        - She asks about things a normal traveler wouldn't care about
        - Her warnings about "forced growth" seem personal
        - She seems to know more about Haven's operations than she should
        - Her concern for the workers feels genuine but calculated

## Scene 3 – Serpents Hope Farm (Modular: Yes • Scene Type: Exploration | Social | Micro-Tasks)

>[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
Fields ripple under Nightveil's last light. Clanks grind down rows of crimson flowers. Wickling laborers move like ghosts between the stalks. Over it all, Haven colors hang—faded, watching.

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The farms spread like a quilt under the dim sky—blocks of crimson blooms that pulse like slow heartbeats, their petals catching the last of Nightveil's light. Paths tramped hard by boots and wheels weave between the rows, and clanks that mumble and clatter as they work, their gears grinding with the sound of broken promises. Lanterns mark patrol loops like watchful eyes, and a cold breeze stirs a wash of pollen in the air that tastes of metal and lost hope. You catch the echo of orders barked from a timber tower; a cough from a worker hunched by a field stove; the slow, iron heartbeat of industry that has pushed this far and farther still. The land answers with a hush that holds warning, and somewhere deep beneath your feet, roots flex with restless purpose.

Senses:

- Sight: Crimson rows pulsing like slow heartbeats; patrol lanterns like watchful eyes; clank silhouettes against plank watchtowers; pollen clouds catching the last light.
- Sound: Clank-gear chatter with mechanical desperation; distant coughs from weary workers; curt orders barked from towers; rustle of blooms that seems to whisper warnings.
- Smell: Metal oil mixed with sap; smoke from field stoves; disinfectant that burns the nose; the metallic bite of corrupted growth.
- Touch: Dust on the hands that feels like dried blood; stalks catching on sleeves with thorny insistence; tremor under boots that speaks of restless earth.
- Taste: Pollen on the tongue that tastes of metal and lost hope; the metallic bite of the breeze; something bitter beneath the surface.

Setting & Immediate Beats:

- This is a task hub; pick 2–3 small scenes before the countdown ends. Start the Thorn-Tide d8 and the Alarm/Pursuit d3.
- **Place the D8 on the table** as an ominous sign - it represents the countdown to the battle
- Tasks (choose 2–3):
    1. **Irrigation Jam:** A clank pump stutters (Difficulty 12; Strength/Knowledge to unjam). Success: calm the lane; gain worker goodwill token. Fail: Alarm +1.
    2. **Worker Triage:** A laborer collapse (Instinct/Presence Difficulty 12). Success: stabilize and learn patrol shift intel. Fail: temp Hesitant on a PC (SRD: Conditions).
    3. **Siren-Bloom Drift:** A patch sings; herds veer (Finesse/Instinct Difficulty 13). Success: redirect; +1 to later animal checks. Fail: the party gets split (lose 1 action at start of Scene 4).
    4. **Storage Stack Ember:** A stack smolders (Agility/Knowledge Difficulty 12). Success: save supplies; reduces Thorn-Tide tick once (one-time). Fail: smoke penalty (disadvantage on first attack next scene).
    5. **Clank Malfunction:** Harvester arm locks near children (Strength/Presence Difficulty 13). Success: protect and earn ally escort during battle. Fail: Alarm +1.
- People to speak with: a Quartermaster (stressed), a Clank Handler (proud), Wickling Steward (wary but cooperative).

Entry Triggers:

- Use on arrival to farms, before the setpiece triggers.

Exit Paths / Outcomes:

- Success: Earn 1–2 tactical edges for Scene 4 (ally escort, saved stacks, patrol intel).
- Mixed: 1 edge, but Alarm at 2/3.
- Failure: Alarm hits 3/3—lockdown; patrol surge complicates Scene 4 (more guards at start).

Optional Lore Implications:

- Steward mentions "bloom seasons felt wrong since the Eye" and a "halfling who played for the night crew" two nights ago (Theodore breadcrumb).

Fear Usage (SRD: Fear Tokens):

- Low: Clank whine becomes a keening; gaining Fear feels like pressure in the ears.
- Medium: Siren-bloom echoes muddle direction; gaining Fear feels like a tug at the heel.
- High: If pool ≥ 4, a worker stampede prompts a quick group Instinct check or temp Hesitant.

Player Spotlights:

- Fern: Field rite to quiet a siren patch (Instinct).
- Fianna: Soothe a panicked herd (Presence/Instinct).
- Gnirth: Cool an overheating pump with controlled flow (Arcana/Instinct).
- Sabriel: Coordinate a bucket line or hold a failing strut (Strength/Presence).
- Snicket: Slide through patrols, douse a stack unseen (Finesse/Agility).

GM Notes:

- Social Focus: Conversation with the Steward reveals more about labor pressures.
- Horror Focus: Describe clanks as invasive—roots crushed, rows "bleeding" sap.
- Action Focus: More moving parts, fewer words; keep tasks snappy.
- Transition Line: A westerly wind rises, carrying with it the sound of distant thunder—or perhaps something else entirely. Lanterns sway like pendulums counting down to something inevitable. Somewhere, a single horn sounds low and mournful, and the earth beneath your feet begins to tremble with restless purpose.

## Scene 4 – The Thorn-Tide (Modular: No • Scene Type: Combat | Setpiece)

>[!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
The wind flips. Blooms shiver. The ground moves—first like breath, then like purpose. From the western verge comes a music you don't want to hear. The rows begin to fall.

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
A tremor rolls through the fields like the earth itself is breathing. The crimson rows sway in a single wave as something unseen presses up from below—the roots flexing with restless purpose, perhaps, or the earth remembering what was stolen from it. A chorus rises that makes your teeth ache and your thoughts scatter like pollen—the siren-flowers calling with voices that shouldn't exist, the herd answering with panicked cries, the clanks complaining as their gears grind against a force they weren't built to know. Then the west breaks: a tide of bodies and thorns, the first line running with the desperation of the hunted, the second leaping with the fury of the corrupted, the third dragging its own mad music with it, and the blooms exploding into red around the point of impact like wounds opening to the sky.

Senses:

- Sight: Stampede silhouettes moving like shadows of nightmares; root-lines surging through the earth like veins of corruption; clank arms flailing with mechanical panic; stacks toppling like dominos of despair.
- Sound: Bloom-siren harmonizing in a chorus that makes your teeth ache; horn calls that sound like the world's last breath; screams that cut through the chaos; gear-teeth shrieking as metal meets corruption.
- Smell: Sap mixed with smoke and hot metal; the musk of panicked animals; something sweet and wrong beneath it all.
- Touch: Ground-lift that makes your stomach drop; grit on lips that tastes of iron; air pressure drops before the hit like the world holding its breath.
- Taste: Iron-bright panic that coats your tongue; the metallic tang of corrupted growth; something bitter that wasn't there before.

Structure & Objectives:

- **When the D8 reaches 1, the battle begins without warning**
- **Four Battle Areas:** The party must choose priorities between:
    1. **Cultivation Fields** - Save the farms (easier flower growth after battle)
    2. **Living Quarters** - Save innocents and infrastructure
    3. **Storage Complex** - Save ready-for-delivery flowers (immediate Haven aid)
    4. **Front Line Battle** - Direct combat (battle ends earlier if successful)

### Battle Area Events

#### **Cultivation Fields Events**
- **Root Surge:** Witherwild roots burst through the soil, threatening to destroy the flower beds
- **Siren-Bloom Drift:** A patch of flowers begins singing, luring workers into danger
- **Clank Malfunction:** Harvesting machines go haywire, threatening workers and crops
- **Bloom Corruption:** The flowers themselves begin to wither and die, spreading the corruption

#### **Living Quarters Events**
- **Worker Evacuation:** Panicked workers need to be safely guided to safety
- **Building Collapse:** Structures are damaged by the attack and need shoring up
- **Child Rescue:** Children are trapped in collapsing buildings
- **Medical Triage:** Injured workers need immediate medical attention

#### **Storage Complex Events**
- **Fire Suppression:** Storage silos are burning and need to be extinguished
- **Supply Protection:** Valuable supplies need to be secured from looters
- **Equipment Sabotage:** Processing equipment is being damaged and needs repair
- **Transport Security:** Loading docks need to be secured for evacuation

#### **Front Line Battle Events**
- **Direct Assault:** Face the main attacking force head-on
- **Commander Elimination:** Take out the enemy leader to disrupt their coordination
- **Defensive Position:** Hold a key position against overwhelming odds
- **Counter-Attack:** Launch a decisive strike to break the enemy's momentum

### Battle Mechanics

- **Round Structure:** Each round, PCs choose which area to focus on
- **Success Tracking:** Track successes in each area separately
- **Victory Conditions:** 
    - **Cultivation Fields:** 3+ successes = farms recover quickly after battle
    - **Living Quarters:** 3+ successes = minimal civilian casualties
    - **Storage Complex:** 3+ successes = Haven gets immediate aid
    - **Front Line Battle:** 2+ successes = battle ends 2 rounds early

### Encounter Clusters

Use the encounter clusters from the separate file, tailored to each battle area:

- **Cultivation Fields:** Focus on environmental hazards and plant-based threats
- **Living Quarters:** Focus on rescue operations and civilian protection
- **Storage Complex:** Focus on fire suppression and supply protection
- **Front Line Battle:** Focus on direct combat with enemy forces

End Conditions:

- Ends when either (a) Wave 2 completes and retreat horn sounds (Fanewraith objective: major field disruption), or (b) Alarm reaches 3 and Haven pulls back everything, or (c) PCs secure two lanes for two consecutive rounds (successful defense).

Fear Usage (SRD: Fear Tokens):

- Low: Root growth encircles boots; gain Fear feels like pins-and-needles.
- Medium: Stampede divides the party across lanes at start of a round.
- High: A PC gains temporary Withered (SRD: Conditions) until they clear 1 HP, after a thorn-swipe.

Player Spotlights:

- Fern: Hedge rite to invert a siren patch (Instinct/Arcana).
- Fianna: Rally panicked laborers; shepherd a calf out of the surge (Presence/Instinct).
- Gnirth: Swell a ditch into a water-wall to redirect the front (Arcana/Knowledge).
- Sabriel: Stand as the line; hold a failing walkway for evacuations (Strength/Presence).
- Snicket: SOS run across lanes; cut a failing stack rig; sneak evac children (Finesse/Agility).

GM Notes:

- Keep initiative abstract; think in "beats" per round and lane choices.
- Use the countdown as tension. At 6: flock lifts suddenly; at 4: bloom-siren harmonizes; at 2: root-lines burst through a clankline.
- Transition Line: The last bodies pass. The siren hushes. Smoke and sap hang in the air like a verdict.

## End-of-Session Hooks & Choices

- Follow the halfling bard’s fingerprints (Theodore) via Steward Vel’s rumor and Elowen’s note.
- Pursue Fanewraith signals (root-lure cadence; skulker retreat path).
- Return to route for Alula (Rite timeline pressure).
- Level Up: PCs reach Level 3 after this session’s conclusion (survival, evacuation, and defense justify advancement).

## Rewards & Handouts

- Worker Goodwill Token: redeem for advantage on one farm negotiation or for 1 allied escort in a later scene.
- Star Map (from Elowen): navigate one hazard without a roll once.
- Saved Stack Receipt: small bounty (10–20 gp equivalent in supplies).
- Handout: A small charcoal map of farm lanes with handwritten cautions (“Drift here,” “Clank path,” “Shift bell”).

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Elowen’s kindness + probing returns in altered forms (she knows what they shared).
- A Wickling ballad about “the bard who held the night crew” circulates—Theodore is very close.
- If the farms suffered heavy loss, Haven’s grip tightens in neighboring settlements (patrol density up; harsher trade checks).
- Rite Progress Clock might tick once if party lingers or shares too much with the wrong ear.
