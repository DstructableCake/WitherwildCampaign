# Theodore Underbrush at Crimson Lady's Veil Farms

## Scenario Overview

Theodore appears at the farms during Scene 3, but he's not there to be rescued or to join the party. Instead, he's there as part of Fanewraith's network, working to gather intelligence and potentially recruit workers for the upcoming operation. This creates complex dynamics and prevents the party from simply taking him with them.
