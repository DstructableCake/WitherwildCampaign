## GM Notes

### Encounter Selection Guidelines:
- **Start with Cluster 1** for a manageable opening
- **Use Cluster 2** for standard pressure
- **Use Cluster 3** for high-stakes moments
- **Use Cluster 4** only if the party is handling everything well
- **Use Cluster 5** for intelligence-focused encounters
- **Use Cluster 6** for environmental-heavy encounters

### Tactical Considerations:
- **Lane Management:** Each encounter is designed to pressure different lanes
- **Escalation:** Later clusters increase in complexity and threat
- **Environmental Hazards:** Clank Harvesters add tactical complexity
- **Coordination:** Some clusters feature leaders that coordinate attacks
- **Flexibility:** Mix and match elements from different clusters as needed

### Fear Token Usage:
- **Low Fear (1-2):** Use basic adversary features
- **Medium Fear (3-4):** Use Fear features and coordinated attacks
- **High Fear (5+):** Use multiple Fear features and create dramatic moments

### Victory Conditions:
- **Primary:** Save civilians and minimize field loss
- **Secondary:** Identify Fanewraith's patterns and timing
- **Tertiary:** Disrupt the assault and force retreat

This system provides flexible, balanced encounters that can adapt to the party's performance and the dramatic needs of the scene.
