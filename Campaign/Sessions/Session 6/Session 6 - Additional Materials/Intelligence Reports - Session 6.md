# Intelligence Reports from Haven

## Message 1: Sabriel's Report on Bloodwing Corruption (Session 2)
**From:** [[Sabriel Arden]], Guardian Knight  
**To:** [[Ambrose Salecia]], Haven Command  
**Date:** After Session 2  
**Subject:** Bloodwing Corruption Escalation

### Report Summary:
"The corruption is stronger than previously reported. The last Bloodwing encountered was approximately 3 meters in size, significantly larger than previous encounters. Suspect they are becoming more aggressive and potentially evolving. Recommend immediate investigation into corruption patterns and potential countermeasures."

### Haven's Response:
*[Hand-written note, passed in secrecy]*

*Arden -*

*Your report confirms our worst fears. The corruption spreads faster than we anticipated. I've seen the patrol reports - creatures that shouldn't exist, growing larger with each encounter. The research division is working around the clock, but I fear we're fighting shadows.*

*Additional patrols have been deployed, but they're stretched thin. The men are nervous, and I don't blame them. Something is stirring in the deep places, and it's watching us.*

*Keep your eyes open, and trust no one outside our circle.*

*- A.S.*

*P.S. - Burn this after reading.*

## Message 2: Sabriel's Report on Kreil's Revelations (Session 4)
**From:** [[Sabriel Arden]], Guardian Knight  
**To:** [[Valerius D'sousza]], Barracks Command  
**Date:** After Session 4  
**Subject:** Critical Intelligence - Fanewraith Threat

### Report Summary:
"Met with Kreil Durn at Old Weir. Major revelations:
- [[Fanewraith]] ([[Elara Voss]]) successfully stole [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]'s [[Reaping Eye]]
- [[Fanewraith]] now plots to steal the [[Sowing Eye]] during [[The Rite of the Turning Gaze]]
- Potential uprising brewing in [[Haven]] led by [[Veilshade]]
- [[Fanewraith]] was a commoner who lost family to [[Serpents Sickness]], seeks revenge
- [[Fianna Fernwhisperer]]'s father ([[Theodore Underbrush]]) sent to [[Alula]] to track [[Fanewraith]]
- Ambushed by assassins during meeting - one captured for interrogation
- Kreil escaped to Haven with critical intelligence"

### Haven's Response:
*[Hand-written note, passed in secrecy]*

*Sabriel -*

*This changes everything. I've read your report three times, and each time it chills me more. Fanewraith... Elara Voss... I remember her from the old days. A healer, gentle with children. To think she's become this.*

*The Eye theft is catastrophic. Phylax is beside himself - the wards around the Sowing Eye have been tripled, but I fear it may not be enough. The Rite approaches, and the timing is too perfect to be coincidence.*

*Theodore Underbrush - I've put eyes on him. If he's working with her, we'll know soon enough. The uprising threat is real. I've heard whispers in the barracks, seen the way some of the men look at the Wickling workers.*

*Stay safe, old friend. The storm is coming.*

*- V.D.*

*P.S. - The assassin you captured... he's been... cooperative. More than I expected.*

## Assassin Interrogation Report
**From:** Haven Intelligence Division  
**To:** Haven Command  
**Date:** Current  
**Subject:** Interrogation of Captured Assassin

### Interrogation Summary:
The captured Inferni assassin (name: Kethis Voss) has been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Initial resistance was overcome through psychological pressure and isolation.

### Key Revelations:
1. **Fanewraith's Network:** The assassin confirms Fanewraith has established a network of operatives throughout Haven and Fanewick
2. **Upcoming Operation:** "Something big is coming within the next week that will make Haven take notice"
3. **Target:** The operation focuses on "restoring balance" and "freeing the land from forced growth"
4. **Timing:** The operation is timed to coincide with "the turning of the seasons" (Rite of the Turning Gaze)
5. **Scope:** Multiple cells are activated across different locations
6. **Fanewraith's Location:** Last known to be in the Alula region, but may have moved

### Specific Intelligence:
- **Crimson Lady's Veil Farms:** Mentioned as a "symbol of Haven's theft" and potential target
- **Worker Discontent:** Fanewraith has been recruiting among Wickling workers
- **Sabotage Plans:** Infrastructure attacks planned to disrupt Haven's operations
- **Theodore Underbrush:** Confirmed to be working with Fanewraith's network
- **Serpent Coins:** Used as identification tokens for network members

### Threat Assessment:
- **Immediate Threat:** High - Operation planned within 7 days
- **Target Priority:** Agricultural facilities, transportation routes, communication networks
- **Method:** Coordinated sabotage and worker uprising
- **Objective:** Disrupt Haven's control and force negotiations

### Recommended Actions:
*[Hand-written note, passed in secrecy]*

*Command -*

*The situation is more dire than we initially assessed. The interrogation has revealed a network deeper than we imagined. Fanewraith's reach extends into our own ranks - I've seen the serpent coins, heard the whispers.*

*The farms are indeed a target, but not the only one. The operation is coordinated, sophisticated. They've been planning this for months, maybe years. The timing with the Rite is no accident - they know our weaknesses.*

*I recommend immediate action:*
*- Double the guard at all agricultural facilities*
*- Deploy additional forces to the Veil Farms - they're vulnerable*
*- Interrogate Theodore if we can find him*
*- Root out the network cells before they strike*

*The assassin was... eager to talk. Too eager. I suspect he's telling us what they want us to know. The real threat may be elsewhere.*

*Time is running out.*

*- Intelligence Division*

*P.S. - Watch your back. Trust no one.*

### Status: CLASSIFIED - EYES ONLY
**Distribution:** Archmage Phylax, Haven Command, Military Intelligence
**Next Update:** Daily reports required until threat neutralized
