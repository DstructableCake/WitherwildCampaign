# Daggerheart – Session 8 Notes

**Title:** _The Lute, the Horn and the Missing Father_  
**Theme:** Recovery, first steps into true Fanewick, and the question of who the wild really belongs to - the river remembers every footprint, and washes none of them away.  
**Setting:** The days immediately following the fall of Serpents Hope, along back roads and river paths that leave Haven's ordered fields behind for the untamed Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds and the looming treetop stronghold of Alula.

## Scars in the Soil

The days after the siege settled into a numb, working silence. The warehouses stood patched but wounded, three walls rebuilt with fresh timber that didn't quite match the old. The Lady's Veil bundles sat stacked and tarped, guarded like sleepers on a sickbed waiting to be shipped out. Beyond them, the fields told a harsher story - wide stretches of soil stained grey-black where the ooze had seeped and sank, the once-white rows now ragged scars. Workers moved through the ruin with shovels and sacks, clearing bodies, breaking hardened roots, avoiding the worst patches where nothing felt safe to touch.

Quartermaster Brill's voice had gone hoarse from shouting. Steward Vel moved quieter still, helping children sort what few belongings had survived the chaos. The party took their long rest in the shadow of what had been lost, the weight of victory and loss settling over them like a heavy cloak.

During this time of recovery, the party found themselves with tasks to complete before their journey deeper into Fanewick. Messages needed to be sent, supplies gathered, and questions asked that might guide their path forward.

---

## Messages and Preparations

Snicket found a moment of quiet to compose coded messages, her fingers moving with practiced precision as she encoded warnings and intelligence. To Delilah Goldtooth, she sent word of the farm's fall - instructions to raise red potion prices, limit sales, and increase security. The warning was clear: supplies would be scarce in the future, and what had happened at Serpents Hope was only the beginning. The message carried the weight of someone who understood both sides of the trade, who knew that information was currency and that survival often meant being one step ahead.

Her second message went to Kreil Durn, a description of the elderly woman they had met at dawn - Elowen, with her mole companion Demetrius. The details were precise: her location, her demeanor, her strange perspective on the tainted creatures. In the world of shadows and secrets, even the most innocent-seeming encounters could hold significance.

Sabriel, meanwhile, took up pen and paper to send his own warnings. To Ambrose Salecia, he wrote of the Leshen sighted at the farms, of the guiding force behind the corruption, of coordinated attacks in daylight that spoke to intelligence and strategy far beyond mindless beasts. The words carried the weight of a soldier who had seen too much, who understood that the enemy was not just the corruption itself, but something - or someone - directing it.

To Mathias Vanta, he sent a mirror of Snicket's warnings to Delilah, ensuring the priest knew of the coming scarcity and the need for caution. The letters felt like anchors, connections to a world they were leaving behind, promises that they would not be forgotten.

## Trading and Gathering

As traders came and went from Serpents Hope in the days following the siege, the party found opportunities to gather supplies and equipment. The market was thin - resources stretched by the attack - but careful bartering and the goodwill earned from their defense of the farms opened doors.

They acquired a collection of useful items: a Fire Jar that promised controlled flame, a Glamour Stone that shimmered with illusion magic, a recipe for Minor Stamina Potions scrawled on weathered parchment, a Suspended Rod that seemed to defy gravity, an Arcane Cloak that whispered with protective energies, and a Skeleton Key that felt warm to the touch. Each item felt like a small victory, a tool that might tip the scales in the dangerous days ahead.

During their time among the traders, they also gathered information about the faint divinities that walked Fanewick. Stories spoke of Sylvan, the Songweaver, who took the form of music made visible - a bard or a bird, depending on who told the tale. They learned of Vaelis, the Forgotten Echo, a figure made of mist who remembered what others had forgotten. And they heard whispers of Rohkin, the Wandering Horn, an ethereal stag with antlers that reached toward the sky - a spirit who demanded strength and respect from those who sought his aid.

## Fern's Communion and the Deceptive Vision

Fern found a quiet corner away from the bustle of recovery, drawing her circle with care. The dark stains beneath her eyes seemed to pulse faintly as she prepared her communion, the memory of her last attempt - the cosmic entity, the black ocean, the voice that had threatened return - still fresh in her mind. But this time, her purpose was different. This time, she sought not answers about the corruption, but guidance for Fianna.

She reached out through the hedge, her voice carrying across the boundary between worlds: "Holy Nikta, one of your acolytes - Fianna - has asked me to ask you whether the grove is prepared for another attempt of an attack against you."

The response came not as the thunderous warning of before, but as something gentler, almost too perfect. Fern's vision shifted, and she found herself looking upon Fianna's grove - the Whitefeather Circle, where the Feathersong Kin made their home. The scene was idyllic, almost impossibly so. The grove was bathed in soft, golden light. Birds sang in harmony, flowers bloomed in perfect cycles, and the people moved with a peace that felt untouched by the corruption spreading across Fanewick. Everything was fine. There was no trouble at all. The vision felt like a balm, a reassurance that some places remained safe.

But something nagged at the edges of Fern's awareness - a sense that the perfection was too complete, too polished. The vision lacked the small imperfections that made places real, the subtle signs of struggle and growth that marked a living community. Yet the message was clear: the grove was safe, prepared, and in no danger.

## Leaving Haven's Shadow

With messages sent and supplies gathered, the party prepared to leave Serpents Hope behind. The sun still shone overhead as they secured a horse and wagon for the journey ahead, Fianna offering to help pull or transform if needed. The weight of what they had accomplished - and what they had lost - hung heavy as they said their farewells to Quartermaster Brill and the survivors of the siege.

The road north began as familiar territory, the neat rows of white flowers giving way gradually to taller grasses and knotty shrubs. But as they traveled, the world began to change its shape. The packed earth road thinned to a pair of wagon ruts, then to a track, then to something that was more habit than path.

Along the way, they discovered the remnants of the battle's reach - corpses of creatures they had faced in the mass combat at Serpents Hope. A Brambleweb Crawler lay partially dissolved in a drainage ditch, its thorny legs curled inward, black ooze still seeping from its wounds. A Flameburst Firefly carcass, chitin cracked and scorched, marked where one of the explosive creatures had met its end. Glasswing Moth fragments scattered like broken glass, their wings still faintly luminescent in the daylight. These were creatures that should not have been this far from the farms - something had driven them, or they had been fleeing something worse.

Soon after, the road became sparse, the wilds taking over completely. Trees grew closer together. Vines hung like curtains. The river's hush swelled from a murmur to a constant presence, just out of sight. The air smelled less of smoke and sweat and more of leaf mold and water. They could almost feel the line where Haven's order ended and Fanewick began.

A border stone rose from a hummock ahead - half-buried, half-overgrown. One face bore the faint, chipped sigil of the Stone Serpent, scales nearly lost beneath moss. The other was stacked with small pebbles and bits of twisted metal: simple offerings from travelers with no banners to claim. This was the threshold, the moment of crossing from one world into another.

## Riverwalker Ground

The forest thickened as they followed the river, branches knitting overhead until the sky was more suggestion than sight. Faint paths appeared and vanished - deer trails, old hunter tracks, roots worn smooth where feet had passed for generations.

Then the scent reached them: woodsmoke that was too steady to be wild, a hint of roasting meat, crushed herbs. A moment later, they spotted it - a thin thread of smoke rising through the canopy, just visible between the leaves.

They took another step - and a quiet voice said, "Enough."

A Wickling man stood half in shadow, half on a fallen log above the path. Leather armor dyed in forest tones, bow unstrung but close at hand. One bare foot rested on a carved spirit cairn of river stones stacked in delicate balance. His eyes flicked from Sabriel's armor to Fern's spores to Gnirth's odd veins, then to Fianna's antlers and Snicket's scars.

"Riverwalker ground," he said, his voice quiet and precise, rarely wasting a word. "You walk it loud. State your hunt, strangers."

This was Silas "Thornfoot," a lean elf Wickling with braided hair bound with river reeds. Thorn tattoos spiraled up his calves in intricate patterns, and his bare feet were hardened by a lifetime on the forest floor. He moved with the silence of someone who had spent years in the wild, reading signs others missed.

The party explained their purpose - travelers seeking passage to Alula, survivors of the Serpents Hope siege, allies to those who respected the land. Silas listened with the careful attention of a guardian, judging them not by their words alone but by how they spoke of land, beasts, and kin.

After discussion about the world, about how things had been getting harder to hunt, about how the water had been tainted, Silas's wariness softened slightly. He recommended they speak with Elder Lyra Willowbrook back at their small camp - someone who might have answers to their questions and guidance for their journey.

---

## The Riverwalker Campfire

The camp emerged from the trees like a natural extension of the forest itself. Hide tents blended into roots, racks of drying fish and meat stood in a nearby clearing, and a central fire crackled with warmth. Camouflaged figures moved between trees with practiced ease, and balanced stone cairns marked spirit paths through the undergrowth.

Elder Lyra Willowbrook was an older Wickling woman with weathered features and a traveler's cloak patched with different clan patterns - a testament to her wanderings. Herb bundles and charms rattled softly as she moved, and her eyes saw deeper than most. She welcomed them with a storyteller's cadence, her voice gentle with low humor.

Around the fire, they learned of the endless spring's impact on Riverwalker life. Herds didn't rest anymore - animals were always active, always moving. Calves were born year-round, but many were born wrong - extra limbs, wrong colors, strange behaviors. Plants grew wrong, some blooming constantly and exhausting the soil, others refusing to grow at all. Spirits were restless, Rohkin's omens confused, the river spirits distressed.

Lyra spoke of Rohkin, the Wandering Horn, with deep knowledge: "If you seek to heal beasts, speak with Rohkin. But know this: he is not the only spirit the herds listen to, not anymore." The warning hung in the air like smoke, a hint of deeper corruption affecting even the divine.

When her attention turned to Gnirth, she studied him with the careful eye of someone who read spiritual connections. "You carry the taste of a drowned place," she said, her voice carrying the weight of recognition. "Tideveil, perhaps. The water there turned thick and did not want to move." The words struck like a physical blow, a thread of memory that Gnirth could not quite grasp but felt in his bones.

Most importantly for Fianna, Lyra confirmed what they had hoped: a traveling man with a lute had passed by the camp a few days previous, with a small horned creature in tow. The description matched Theodore, and Fianna's heart lifted with a mixture of hope and fear - he was alive, he was close, but what had brought him here, and what had happened since?

Lyra asked the party to help cleanse the water upstream on their way to Alula, after giving them information about the place. It would be enough to stave off the taint for a little while, but not forever. The corruption was spreading, and temporary measures were all they could offer.

As the fire died to embers and stories faded into the night, the Riverwalkers showed them a narrow path that led deeper into Fanewick, following the river upstream. "The path grows harder from here," Silas warned. "The river remembers what it used to be, and what it's become. Watch your step."

## Qui'Gar's Gift

As the party headed off from the campsite, following the river path deeper into Fanewick, Fern spotted something that made her pause. Tucked into a briar patch near the water's edge, a small, overgrown shrine stood half-hidden by thorny vines.

It was a shrine to Qui'Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End - the same faint divinity Fern had been leaving cake tributes to throughout their journey. The shrine showed signs of recent offerings: crumbs of cake scattered around the base, some fresh, some old and moldering. But what caught Fern's attention was what sat in a clay bowl at the shrine's base.

A single slice of cake rested there, and from its center, a small stem sprouted - pale green with delicate thorns, pulsing with faint bioluminescence like a heartbeat. The sprout was tiny, no larger than a thumb, but it felt alive in a way that went beyond simple plant growth. When Fern approached, the thorns unfurled slightly, and the bioluminescence brightened, as if recognizing her presence.

A whisper might have been heard on the wind, soft as thorns brushing against silk: *"A gift for the one who remembers the sweetness of endings... Tend it well, and it may grow to serve rather than consume."*

## The Tainted Ford

Further up the river, as the sun set and Nightveil's perpetual twilight began to claim the sky, they came across a stone crossing where black tar was visibly tainting the river. The water flowed dark and thick in patches, and the stones of the ford were stained with the same corruption they had seen at Serpents Hope.

Across from the ford, something caught the moonlight - a glint of reflection, a shine that shouldn't be there. But first, they had to cross.

The party worked together to bless and purify the water, calling upon their various magics and faiths to cleanse the taint. It was enough - the corruption receded temporarily, the water running clearer for a moment, long enough for them to make their way across the stone crossing to the other side. The purification was a stopgap measure, as Lyra had warned, but it was enough to get them closer to Alula, the sounds of the large treetop village just audible in the distance.

---

## Evidence of Struggle

Once across the ford, they investigated the source of the moonlight's reflection. What they found sent a chill through Fianna's heart.

The shining came from the remnants of a lute, its strings catching and reflecting the moon like silver threads. The instrument was broken, damaged beyond simple repair, and it lay discarded among the undergrowth. Next to it, partially hidden under leaves, was what looked like a broken-off section of antler - small, about the size of a thumb, but unmistakable in its shape and texture.

Fianna recognized both immediately. The lute was her father's - Theodore's instrument, the one he had played for her as a child, the one that had carried songs of Nikta and balance. The antler fragment was Brindle's - her corrupted companion, the fox with antlers who had been taken by the Witherwild. They had been together. They had been here.

The area around showed clear signs of struggle. Broken sticks lay scattered, blood stained the ground in dark patches, and tracks led off into the bush toward Alula. Something had happened here - an ambush, a fight, a desperate flight.

Speaking to the trees through her druidic connection, Fianna learned what the ancient witnesses had seen: a few days prior, a man and an animal had been ambushed by dark creatures. One creature stood 8-9 feet tall, two more of normal build, and another smaller, similar to a halfling. The description sent shivers down spines - Inferni assassins, the same kind they had faced at the Old Weir, working in coordination with something larger, something worse.

Theodore and Brindle had been together. They had been attacked. Brindle had been injured - the antler fragment told that story clearly. Theodore's lute had been damaged in the struggle. Whether they had been captured or had escaped but were in danger, the evidence was clear: they were close, and they needed help.

## First Glimpse of Alula

The path climbed toward Alula, roots becoming stairs in places. The river slipped further and further below, its noise dimming to a distant hush. Trees here were older, broader, their trunks like pillars, their branches interlocking in dizzying webs.

Then they crested a final rise, and the world opened.

Ahead and above, woven into the very canopy, hung a village of platforms and rope-bridges, huts and halls and hanging gardens. Lanterns made from bloom clusters swayed in the breeze, casting soft light that danced across bark and leaf. Walkways wound from trunk to trunk, some barely visible, others crowded with distant figures moving like ants suspended in the air.

Lower down, closer to the forest floor, smaller platforms served as guard posts and waystations, where Wicklings and other folk stood watch with spears and bows. The city of Alula was vast, spread over three different core layers: the treetops (SunLofts) where the council, scholars, observatories, government and enforcement buildings were; the mid-level (Heartwalk) where markets, stalls, traders and houses were, much more condensed, favella-style; and the undercanopy (Shadowreach) where refugee quarters, smugglers dens, and black markets could be found, less dense, with a lot of wilds around that concealed entrances.

The party was about to head into enemy territory, not knowing where the Fanewraith would be but aware that there were potentially dozens of her assassins and spies around the city. They would have to tread lightly, trust carefully, and move with the knowledge that any misstep could mean discovery.

They knew some details that might help: any remnants of Haven would likely be met with hostility, so Sabriel would need to be careful. Snicket had a delivery required for Mr Tilde, a Galapa creature somewhere in the city. They knew what the original assassins wore and looked like, along with some names that might prove helpful. They knew the serpent coin was used as identification among those in the network.

But as they approached the treetops reaching up high into the sky, they saw something that made them pause. A sign that said "Welcome to Alula" stood at the path's edge, and below it was a bowl with a note.

The bowl contained remnants of minty soup, still warm, as if left recently. And the note, written in a familiar hand, read:

"Really looking forward to seeing you all again, I really enjoyed our last meet. E"

The initial was unmistakable. Elowen. The elderly woman they had met at dawn, who had shared a meal with them, who had seemed so kind and gentle. She had been here. She had left this message. And the implication was clear: she had known they were coming. She had known where they were going. And she was waiting for them.

The session ended there, with Alula looming above them like a promise and a threat, with Theodore and Brindle's fate unknown, and with the knowledge that nothing in Fanewick was quite what it seemed.
