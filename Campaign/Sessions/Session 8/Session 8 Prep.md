# Scene 1 – Scars in the Soil (Serpents Hope Aftermath)

**Scene Type:** Social | Reflection | Light Investigation  

> [!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
> By the time the last wagons roll in from the barracks, Serpents Hope has slipped into a numb, working silence. The warehouses stand patched but wounded, three walls rebuilt with fresh timber that doesn’t quite match the old. The Lady’s Veil bundles sit stacked and tarped, guarded like sleepers on a sickbed waiting to be shipped out.  
>   
> Beyond them, the fields tell a harsher story. Wide stretches of soil are stained grey-black where the ooze seeped and sank, the once-white rows now ragged scars. Workers move through the ruin with shovels and sacks, clearing bodies, breaking hardened roots, avoiding the worst patches where nothing feels safe to touch.  
>   
> Quartermaster Brill’s voice has gone hoarse from shouting. Steward Vel moves quieter still, helping children sort what few belongings survived the chaos. Clank Handler Pex kneels beside a half-disassembled machine, fingers shaking as he pries black residue from its gears.  
>   
> We return to the adventure where you all take a moment to breath and rest up, taking in the destruction of the farms, and prepare for your journey deep into the wilds of Fanewick

### Senses

- **Sight:** Black-veined furrows, tar-dark pits where ooze soaked deep, patched warehouse walls, tarps over salvaged Veil bundles, lines of wrapped bodies ready for transport.
- **Sound:** Soft murmur of exhausted conversation, clanks winding down, creak of wheelbarrows, a child’s thin laugh breaking the quiet, distant ravens.
- **Smell:** Wet ash, sap, oil, antiseptic, faint floral ghost of crushed Lady’s Veil.
- **Touch:** Gritty soot on fingers, clammy morning air, residual warmth in scorched beams.
- **Taste:** Bitter smoke at the back of the throat, metallic tang of dried blood and dust.

### Setting & Immediate Beats

Use this as a calm RP hub:

- **Check in with key NPCs**:
  - **Quartermaster Brill** – Logistics, official thanks, Haven reward.
  - **Steward Vel** – Wickling perspective, land grief, Theodore lead.
  - **Pex** – Corruption’s effect on machines, gear fixes, rumor of Alula.

- **Allow personal scenes**:
  - Prayer and atonement (Sabriel).
  - Sample study and Weft-sense (Fern & Gnirth).
  - Survivor comfort/animal care (Fianna).
  - Quiet ledger/route checks (Snicket).

#### Information & Hooks to Deliver

- **Theodore Sighting (Fianna Focus):**  
  Steward Vel:  
  > “A halfling bard, aye. Played for the night crew three nights past. Soft hands, loud heart. Left us a song about eyes and storms—and headed upriver toward the tree-village. Alula, they call it. Said he had someone to find… or maybe something to return.”

- **Alula Route (Group):**  
  Brill or Vel can confirm:
  - Fastest safe path from Serpents Hope to Alula is **along the Great River**, through territory patrolled/used by the **[[Riverwalkers]]**, then up to Alula’s lower platforms.
  - Haven maps are “thin” there; Sabriel knows his authority effectively ends at the river.

- **Corruption Escalation (Fern / Gnirth / Pex):**  
  Pex’s angle: clanks gummed by ooze; “like the water’s gone wrong inside the metal.”  
  Fern/Gnirth studying residue:  
  - It reacts faintly to **Fungril network** and to **Gnirth’s magic**, but weaker than at Serpents Hope.
  - It seems to **follow watercourses** – a hint that river crossings may be risky.

- **Reward / Supplies:**  
  Brill thanks them:
  - **Supplies:** 1–2 uses of rations each, a few basic potions or field dressings.  
  - **Coin or barter equivalent:** 30–50 gp total or Haven scrip.  
  - **Letter of Passage:** A simple note that says they aided the farms—might help if Haven patrols challenge them later.

### Fear Usage

- **Low:** Spend 1 Fear for an omen: a rescued flower bundle has a single black-veined blossom that won’t die, even when cut. Gaining Fear feels like the land quietly holding a grudge.
- **Medium:** Spend 1 Fear so that anyone touching the hardened ooze gets a phantom sensation of **roots tightening around their ankles**—purely narrative, but unsettling.

### Player Spotlights

- **Sabriel:**  
  Steward Vel or a worker asks, “Do your gods think this is a good trade?” How does Sabriel explain or wrestle with what was saved vs. what was lost?

- **Snicket:**  
  In the chaos, she notices **Veil crates** being tallied against records. Does she peek; do the numbers add up; is there a hint of ongoing siphoning?

- **Fern:**  
  Kneeling by a tainted furrow, what does the Fungril network feel like here—muted, screaming, or eerily quiet?

- **Fianna:**  
  As she tends wounds, a child hums a tune Theodore once played. How does that land? Does she ask; does she keep it close?

- **Gnirth:**  
  Black streaks in a drainage ditch ripple when he passes. Does he stop to test it? (Foreshadow for Scene 3.)

### GM Options / Variations

- **Social Focus:**  
  Run small, intimate conversations; let PCs help bury dead, replant a tiny symbolic row, or lead a simple blessing over the fields.

- **Horror Focus:**  
  Make the soil “creak” underfoot in one patch—like roots adjusting to a new shape. No attack, just unease.

- **Action-Light Skill Checks:**  
  Quick rolls to help load wagons, repair a clank, or stabilize a collapsing fence; success offers +1 forward on a related check later.

**Transition Line:**  
When the last body is loaded and the last thanks spoken, the road north waits. The smell of sap and smoke clings to you as the fields of Serpents Hope fall behind, and the river’s distant murmur grows louder with each step.

---

# Scene 2 – Leaving Haven’s Shadow (Border & Threshold Travel)

**Scene Type:** Travel Montage | Social  

> [!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
> The straight farm roads end. The world narrows to deer paths and wet stone, and the river’s voice grows louder than Haven’s.

> [!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
> As you leave the last fenced plots of Serpents Hope behind, the world changes its shape. The neat rows of white flowers give way to taller grasses and knotty shrubs. The packed earth road thins to a pair of wagon ruts, then to a track, then to something that is more habit than path.  
>   
> A border stone rises from a hummock ahead—half-buried, half-overgrown. One face bears the faint, chipped sigil of the Stone Serpent, scales nearly lost beneath moss. The other is stacked with small pebbles and bits of twisted metal: simple offerings from travelers with no banners to claim.  
>   
> Beyond it, trees grow closer together. Vines hang like curtains. The river’s hush swells from a murmur to a constant presence, just out of sight. The air smells less of smoke and sweat and more of leaf mold and water. You can almost feel the line where Haven’s order ends and Fanewick begins.

### Senses

- **Sight:** Moss-eaten border stone, half-faded Stone Serpent sigil, small cairns of river stones, track fading into undergrowth.
- **Sound:** Distant river, wind in canopy, creak of harness and gear, occasional bird calls.
- **Smell:** Damp earth, leaf litter, faint tang of river silt, hint of flowers that aren’t cultivated.
- **Touch:** Rough stone under hand at border, brush snagging on clothes, humidity sticking to skin.
- **Taste:** Cleaner air, still with a ghost of ash from Serpents Hope.

### Setting & Beats

**Before the Border Stone – Battle Remnants:**

As the party travels toward the border, they encounter signs of the recent battle's reach:

- **Dead Creatures (Corruption Study Opportunity):**
  - A **Brambleweb Crawler** corpse lies partially dissolved in a drainage ditch, its thorny legs curled inward. Black ooze still seeps from its wounds, but it's beginning to harden. Fern or Gnirth can study it (Instinct/Arcana) to learn about the corruption's nature—how it spreads, what it feeds on.
  - A **Flameburst Firefly** carcass, its chitin cracked and scorched, lies near a burned patch of grass. The explosion pattern suggests it died violently. Snicket or Sabriel might notice something odd about its positioning—was it trying to flee something?
  - **Glasswing Moth** fragments scattered like broken glass, their wings still faintly luminescent. Fianna might sense something: were they trying to escape the Leshen's call?

- **Optional Investigation:**
  - **Instinct / Knowledge:** Recognize these creatures shouldn't be this far from Serpents Hope—something drove them, or they were fleeing.
  - **Finesse / Perception:** Spot drag marks or tracks suggesting something larger moved through here recently.
  - **Spellcast / Arcana (Fern/Gnirth):** Sense residual corruption—is it spreading, or contained? Does it react to their Fungril nature?

- **Reward for Investigation:**
  - Learn that corruption spreads along watercourses (foreshadowing Scene 3).
  - Notice that some creatures show signs of being *herded* or *driven* rather than attacking naturally.
  - Gain +1 forward on next corruption-related check.

This is your **threshold moment** into Fanewick proper:

- **Border Stone Interaction:**
  - Sabriel might touch the Stone Serpent sigil, leave or remove a token, or say a prayer.
  - Fern / Fianna may add a small offering to the "free side" cairn: blossom, spore, small bone, feather.
  - Gnirth may feel nothing—or a strange echo—if he touches the stone; the land here is *not* Tideveil.

- **Short Travel Montage (a few vignettes):**
  - A deer with bark-like ridges looks at them too long, then bolts.
  - A patch of mushrooms glows faintly in full daylight—Oove's influence lingering.
  - They pass one old, disused Haven watch-post, half collapsed, already reclaimed by ivy.

### Fear Usage

- **Low:** Spend 1 Fear to show a **single crow** with one glassy, insect-like eye watching from the border stone. The feeling of being *noticed* lingers for a minute, then fades.

### Player Spotlights

- **Sabriel:**  
  Does he swear an oath on the border—“to protect these people from what my own brought”? Does he leave his old sigil behind or carry it in?

- **Snicket:**  
  Spots small smugglers’ marks scratched into the stone base—proof that others have moved goods and people through here unseen.

- **Fern & Fianna:**  
  They can sense faint traces of **Rohkin** or **Oove** in the wild—subtle compared to Serpents Hope, but present.

- **Gnirth:**  
  He feels the river like a low note in his chest now—no visions yet, but a promise.

### GM Options

- **If pacing is slow:**  
  Add a brief Haven patrol seen in the far distance, not engaging—just a reminder they’re leaving that world.

- **If pacing is fast:**  
  Keep this to a short emotional beat, then move quickly toward the river in Scene 3.

**Transition Line:**  
The border stone falls behind, swallowed by moss and distance. The river's voice draws you onward, and somewhere ahead, the scent of woodsmoke and the murmur of voices suggest you're not alone in these woods.

---

# Scene 3 – Riverwalker Campfire (Social Hub & Lore)

**Scene Type:** Social | Worldbuilding | Personal Hooks  

> [!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
> The first sign you're not alone is the smell of cooking meat. The second is the arrow you almost don't see.

> [!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
> The forest thickens as you follow the river, branches knitting overhead until the sky is more suggestion than sight. Faint paths appear and vanish—deer trails, old hunter tracks, roots worn smooth where feet have passed for generations.  
>   
> Then the scent reaches you: woodsmoke that's too steady to be wild, a hint of roasting meat, crushed herbs. A moment later, you spot it: a thin thread of smoke rising through the canopy, just visible between the leaves.  
>   
> You take another step—and a quiet voice says, "Enough."  
>   
> A Wickling man stands half in shadow, half on a fallen log above the path. Leather armor dyed in forest tones, bow unstrung but close at hand. One bare foot rests on a carved spirit cairn of river stones stacked in delicate balance. His eyes flick from Sabriel's armor to Fern's spores to Gnirth's odd veins, then to Fianna's antlers and Snicket's scars.  
>   
> "Riverwalker ground," he says. "You walk it loud. State your hunt, strangers."

### Senses

- **Sight:** Camouflaged figures between trees, balanced stone cairns, racks of drying fish and meat in a nearby clearing, simple hide tents blending into roots. **Signs of change:** Some tents show patches of unusual materials—Haven cloth, repurposed banners. A few children play with carved toys that look like corrupted creatures, processing trauma through play. Elder Lyra's cloak shows more patches than before—clans are sharing resources more than they used to.
- **Sound:** Low crackle of a central fire, murmur of conversation in Wickling dialects, clink of tools sharpening, river always just at the edge of hearing. **New sounds:** Occasional worried whispers about "the endless spring," mentions of herds behaving strangely, children asking when the seasons will return.
- **Smell:** Smoke, roasting fish or game, wild herbs, sweat, damp earth. **Underlying notes:** A faint, almost imperceptible scent of too-much-growth, like flowers blooming out of season.
- **Touch:** Warmth of fire when invited in, rough log benches, slightly sticky resin on fingers if they touch hanging herbs. Some of the wood feels... wrong. Too smooth, too alive, as if it's still growing.
- **Taste:** Savory, simple camp food if they share a meal. The food is good, but there's a sense that ingredients are harder to find—some plants don't taste quite right anymore.

### NPCs

#### Silas “Thornfoot” (Riverwalker Ranger)

- **Appearance:** Lean elf or faun-blooded Wickling; braided hair bound with river reeds; bare feet hardened by forest floor. Thorn tattoos spiral up his calves.
- **Voice:** Quiet, precise; rarely wastes a word.
- **Personality:** Wary but fair. Judges people by how they speak of land, beasts, and kin.
- **Soundbites:**
  - “River remembers bootprints longer than banners.”
  - “We hunt to live, not to bleed the world.”
  - “You smell of ooze and steel. That’s a poor perfume in these parts.”

#### Elder Lyra Willowbrook (Visiting Wanderborne Herbalist/Shaman)

- **Appearance:** Older Wickling woman with a pack of herbs and charms, a traveler’s cloak patched with different clan patterns.
- **Voice:** Gentle, low humor; storyteller cadence.
- **Personality:** Curious, spiritually attuned; recognizes Fungril and Druid signs quickly.
- **Soundbites:**
  - “Roots talk if you let them. So do scars.”
  - “You come from Monks Eliegh’s shadow, yes? The stone there is loud.”
  - “Rohkin’s horns have been restless. Herds do not sleep easy.”

#### Galapa Hermit (Optional Add-On if you want a weirder voice)

- **Appearance:** Stocky amphibious humanoid, moss and lichen growing on shell-like plates; uses a carved driftwood staff.
- **Voice:** Slow, watery consonants; often pauses mid-sentence to think.
- **Personality:** Odd, insightful; sees patterns others miss.
- **Soundbites:**
  - “I remember when the river ran clear. I remember when you did not.”
  - “Water keeps secrets, but not from those who drown.”

### Beats & Topics

This is your **big RP anchor** for the session.

#### 1. Establishing Trust

- Silas demands to know:
  - Why they carry **Haven steel** beyond the fields.
  - Why their boots smell of **ooze** and burned flowers.
  - What they seek at **Alula**.

Skill prompts:

- **Presence (Sabriel / Fianna):** Honest summary of Serpents Hope and their intent to stop worse coming.
- **Instinct / Finesse (Snicket):** Reading the camp’s mood, choosing the right person to speak to.
- **Instinct / Spellcast (Fern / Gnirth):** Sensing whether these people are hostile, neutral, or potential allies.

Outcomes:

- **Success:** Welcome into the camp clearing, offered food, stories, and safe rest.
- **Mixed:** Tolerated at the fire but under watch; some questions get curt answers.
- **Failure:** Silas insists they camp **outside** the main circle; still allows brief talk, but no lingering.

#### 2. Theodore Thread (Fianna Spotlight)

Elder Lyra or a younger hunter remembers:

> "A halfling with a lute passed this way a few days ago. Called himself Theodore. Played for our children, traded stories for stew. Asked after the Great Owl and the eyes she lost. He followed the river up-tree, toward Alula. Seemed… troubled. Like a man who'd walked too long with weight he wouldn't put down."

Optional details (choose 1–2):

- He talked about **balance** and being unsure if returning the Eye would restore it or break it further.
- He left an **old feather charm** at a spirit cairn for Nikta—Fianna might find or recognize it.
- He mentioned being sent to Alula by **Mathias**/Kreil.

#### 3. Rohkin & Witherwild (Fern / Fianna)

Lyra or Silas shares:

- Herds along the river have started:
  - Avoiding certain **tainted banks** (like the ford they just crossed).
  - Moving out of season, calves being born wrong.
- Rohkin’s omens have been vague and upset:
  - Storms without rain.
  - Horns heard at night with no sign of stags by dawn.

Hooks:

- Seed your future quest **“Whispers of the Wandering Horn”**:  
  > “If you seek to heal beasts, speak with Rohkin. But know this: he is not the only spirit the herds listen to, not anymore.”

#### 4. Gnirth's Past (Gnirth Spotlight)

The Galapa hermit or Lyra studies Gnirth and says something like:

> "You carry the taste of a drowned place. Tideveil, perhaps. The water there turned thick and did not want to move."

Possible micro-vision if you want:

- Spend 1 Fear and give Gnirth a **brief flash**:
  - A circle of stones half-submerged.
  - Black water swallowing chanting voices.
  - A glimmer of a stone idol cracked in half.

No full vision sequence yet—just a reminder that answers lie *back* in his past as much as ahead.

#### 4b. Fern's Cake Tribute & Qui'Gar's Gift (Fern Spotlight)

**Location:** As part of Scene 3 (Riverwalker Campfire) if they explore the area around the campfire, or between Scene 3 and Scene 4 as they travel deeper into Fanewick.

**Setup:**
- As the party follows the river path, Fern spots a **small, overgrown shrine** tucked into a briar patch near the water's edge.
- Thorny vines drape over a weathered stone altar, and at its base sits a **clay bowl**—similar to the one she saw in Session 2, but this one holds what looks like a **small, flickering candle**.
- Upon closer inspection, the "candle" is actually a **tiny sprout**—a pale green shoot with delicate thorns, pulsing with faint bioluminescence like a heartbeat.

**Fern's Recognition:**
- Fern recognizes this as a **Qui'Gar shrine**—the same faint divinity she's been leaving cake tributes to throughout the campaign.
- The shrine shows signs of recent offerings: **crumbs of cake** scattered around the base, some fresh, some old and moldering.
- If Fern has been leaving cakes, she might recognize her own handiwork—or see that others have followed her example.

**The Baby Plant Monster:**
- The sprout in the bowl is a **baby Thorn-Cake Mimic**—a nascent form of the plant monster Sara described.
- It's currently dormant, appearing as a harmless candle/sprout.
- When Fern approaches, it **reacts to her presence**—the thorns unfurl slightly, and the bioluminescence brightens.
- **Qui'Gar's whisper** might be heard: *"A gift for the one who remembers the sweetness of endings... Tend it well, and it may grow to serve rather than consume."*

**Mechanics & Roleplay:**
- Fern can attempt to **bond with the sprout**:
  - **Instinct / Spellcast (Hedge Witch):** Sense its nature and needs.
  - **Presence:** Offer it a small cake tribute (if she has one) or a drop of her own blood (mark 1 Stress) as a binding offering.
- Success: The sprout **accepts her**, curling around her finger like a tiny vine. It becomes a **companion** that will grow over time.
- Failure: The sprout remains wary but doesn't attack—it's too young. Fern can try again later.

**What It Is:**
- A **Thorn-Cake Mimic** in its earliest stage.
- Currently harmless, about the size of a thumb.
- If tamed, it will grow slowly over the campaign, eventually becoming a companion that can:
  - Disguise itself as food (cakes, fruits) to lure enemies.
  - Grow thorns for defense.
  - Eventually reach "baby" size (small dog) and potentially larger if fed properly.
- **Warning:** If mistreated or if Fern dies, it could revert to its wild, predatory nature.

**Narrative Hooks:**
- Elder Lyra might recognize it: *"Qui'Gar's thorns take many forms. This one chose you. Be careful—it feeds on endings, not beginnings."*
- Fianna might sense something: *"It feels... hungry. But not for food. For something else."*
- Gnirth might feel a void-echo: *"It wants to consume. Like the ooze. But smaller. Contained."*

**Future Growth:**
- Over sessions, the sprout can grow if Fern:
  - Feeds it cake tributes regularly.
  - Uses it in combat (it learns).
  - Protects it from harm.
  - Makes difficult choices that involve "endings" (Qui'Gar's domain).
- Eventually, it could become a **combat companion** or **utility pet** that helps the party.

**GM Notes:**
- This is a **long-term investment** for Fern's character arc.
- The plant monster's growth should be slow and meaningful.
- Use it to explore themes of **taming the wild**, **balance between nurture and nature**, and **the cost of power**.
- If Fern neglects it or treats it poorly, it could become a problem later.

#### 5. Fern’s Hedge & the Cosmic Threat

If Fern asks about omens or the **tar-black entity** she contacted:

- Lyra can say:
  > “Some things swim deeper than faint divinities. Old things. Not gods, not beasts. Currents. You brushed one. You’ll need both roots and stars to keep your feet if it pulls again.”

She might offer a **small, safe ritual**:

- Fern reads a few **animal bones** by the campfire:
  - You can drop one cryptic line about the toad entity:
    - “It rises when cycles break.”
    - “It likes to come back to old wounds.”

#### 6. How the Reaping Eye Theft Changed Everything (Worldbuilding & Atmosphere)

**The Endless Spring's Impact on Riverwalker Life:**

- **Before the Theft:** Riverwalkers lived in harmony with natural seasons—hunting in autumn, preserving in winter, planting knowledge in spring, harvesting in summer. They followed Rohkin's herds, which moved with the seasons.

- **After the Theft (Now):**
  - **Herds Don't Rest:** Animals are always active, always moving. Calves are born year-round, but many are born wrong—extra limbs, wrong colors, strange behaviors. Riverwalkers have to hunt more often because nothing hibernates or migrates properly.
  - **Plants Grow Wrong:** Some plants bloom constantly, exhausting the soil. Others refuse to grow at all. Riverwalkers have to travel further to find familiar herbs and plants that still behave as they should.
  - **Spirits Are Restless:** Rohkin's omens are confused. The river spirits (like Lathun) seem distressed. Faint divinities appear more often, but their messages are muddled—they're trying to maintain balance in a world that's lost its rhythm.
  - **Clans Share More:** With resources unpredictable, clans that used to be independent now share knowledge, supplies, and territory more freely. Elder Lyra's patched cloak represents this—she travels between clans, sharing what she learns.
  - **Children Ask Hard Questions:** "When will winter come?" "Why do the deer have too many legs?" "Why can't we sleep when it's always day?" Riverwalkers are struggling to explain a world that doesn't make sense anymore.

**Optional Tasks & Interactions:**

1. **Help with a Hunt (Sabriel / Snicket / Fianna):**
   - A small group is preparing to hunt a deer that's been acting strangely—too aggressive, wrong-colored fur. PCs can help track it, and the hunt reveals how corruption is affecting even "normal" animals.
   - **Reward:** Learn about corruption patterns, gain Riverwalker respect, maybe get some supplies.

2. **Herb Gathering with Elder Lyra (Fern / Fianna):**
   - Lyra needs to gather herbs, but some patches have been corrupted. She can teach PCs how to identify safe vs. corrupted plants, and share stories about how the land used to be.
   - **Reward:** Gain knowledge about plant corruption, learn about pre-theft Fanewick, get useful herbs.

3. **Repair a Spirit Cairn (Any PC):**
   - A spirit cairn near the camp has been disturbed—stones knocked over, offerings scattered. PCs can help rebuild it, learning about Riverwalker spiritual practices.
   - **Reward:** Gain Riverwalker token, learn about faint divinities, feel the land's gratitude.

4. **Storytelling Circle (All PCs):**
   - Around the fire, Riverwalkers share stories. PCs can share their own stories, or listen to tales of how things used to be. This is where they learn about the Reaping Eye theft from a Fanewick perspective.
   - **Reward:** Deep lore, emotional connection, understanding of cultural impact.

5. **Help with Children (Fianna / Fern):**
   - Children are processing trauma through play—carving toys of corrupted creatures, asking questions about the world. PCs can help explain, comfort, or play, showing their care for the next generation.
   - **Reward:** Gain trust, learn about how the theft affected families, emotional connection.

6. **Water Purification Ritual (Gnirth / Fern):**
   - The camp's water source is showing early signs of taint. Galapa Hermit or Elder Lyra can guide a ritual to purify it, teaching PCs about water's memory and how corruption spreads.
   - **Reward:** Learn about water corruption, help the camp, gain spiritual knowledge.

#### 7. Sabriel & Snicket – Haven vs Fanewick

- Silas knows of the **Stone Serpent knights**:
  - "You burned our bog guardian for your cure," he might say. "The endless spring is your doing, even if you didn't pull the Eye yourself."
- Sabriel can:
  - Own that truth, talk about why he's here now, and signal he wants to defend rather than dominate.
  - Learn that Riverwalkers don't hate all Havenites—they hate what Haven *did*, and they judge people by their actions, not their origins.

- Snicket can:
  - Swap **routes and cant** with a Riverwalker scout.
  - Learn that **Mr Tilde** has friends in Alula's undercanopy and that Riverwalkers sometimes ferry his parcels upriver.
  - Discover that some Riverwalkers have become smugglers themselves—moving people and supplies away from corrupted areas, helping refugees.

### Mechanical Boons

If things go well:

- **Safe Rest:** Count this as a safe camp—Stress clear, some HP back, etc.
- **Riverwalker Token:** A simple **carved river stone** or **thorn-marked charm** that:
  - Gives advantage or +1 on **one** future social roll with Wildborne/Wicklings or Riverwalkers.
- **Route Intel:** Advantage on navigation rolls when skirting the Hunting Grounds in the future.

### Fear Usage

- **Low:** Spend 1 Fear for a moment where all the **campfire sparks drift in the same direction**, no matter the wind—toward Alula. It feels like the land nudging them on.

- **Medium:** Spend 1 Fear to have a distant **chorus of howls** or thunder roll through the forest mid-conversation, briefly silencing the camp. Everyone feels the skin-prickle of being between predators and prey.

### Transition Line

As the fire dies to embers and the last stories fade, the Riverwalkers show you a narrow path that leads deeper into Fanewick, following the river upstream. "The path grows harder from here," Silas warns. "The river remembers what it used to be, and what it's become. Watch your step."

# Scene 5 – Evidence & First Glimpse of Alula (Cliffhanger Ending)

**Scene Type:** Short Travel | Discovery | Cliffhanger  

> [!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
> The path climbs toward Alula, but something catches the light before you reach the treetops.

### Evidence of Theodore & Brindle (Discovery Before Alula)

**As the party approaches Alula, they find clues:**

- **Theodore's Broken Lute String:**
  - Caught on a thorn bush near the path, the string is snapped and frayed—not cut cleanly, but broken under stress. It's recognizable as a lute string to anyone who knows instruments.
  - If Fianna examines it (Instinct/Knowledge), she recognizes it as the type her father used—he preferred a particular brand of strings.
  - The thorns around it show signs of struggle—some are bent, some have cloth fibers caught in them.

- **Brindle's Antler Fragment:**
  - A few feet from the lute string, partially hidden under leaves, lies a fragment of antler. It's small, about the size of a thumb, but Fianna recognizes it immediately—it's part of Brindle's antler. The break is fresh, and there are scratch marks suggesting it was torn off, not shed naturally.
  - If Fianna touches it (Instinct), she gets a brief flash: Brindle running, Theodore trying to help, something large and dark pursuing them. The vision is fragmented and unclear, but the fear is palpable.

- **What This Means:**
  - Theodore found Brindle on his journey to Alula.
  - They were together when something attacked them.
  - Brindle was injured (antler broken off).
  - Theodore's lute was damaged in the struggle.
  - They may have been captured, or they may have escaped but are in danger.

- **Optional Investigation:**
  - **Finesse / Perception:** Find more clues—footprints, drag marks, blood (if any).
  - **Instinct / Knowledge (Fianna):** Sense how recent this was (hours? a day?), and whether Brindle is still alive (she can feel a faint connection if he is).
  - **Spellcast / Arcana (Fern/Gnirth):** Sense if corruption was involved in whatever attacked them.

**This discovery creates urgency**—Theodore and Brindle were here recently, and something happened. The party now has motivation to rush to Alula to find them.

> The path climbs. Roots become stairs, in places. The river slips further and further below, its noise dimming to a distant hush. Trees here are older, broader, their trunks like pillars, their branches interlocking in dizzying webs.

> Then you crest a final rise, and the world opens.  
>   
> Ahead and above, woven into the very canopy, hangs a village of platforms and rope-bridges, huts and halls and hanging gardens. Lanterns made from bloom clusters sway in the breeze, casting soft light that dances across bark and leaf. Walkways wind from trunk to trunk, some barely visible, others crowded with distant figures moving like ants suspended in the air.  
>   
> Lower down, closer to the forest floor, you see smaller platforms—guard posts and waystations, where a few Wicklings and other folk stand watch with spears and bows. One of them calls out as you approach, voice carrying easily through the still air:  
>   
> "Travelers on the north path! State your business in Alula!"

### Senses

- **Sight:** Massive tree trunks, layered platforms, rope bridges swaying; bioluminescent blooms; faint scar where one great bough has clearly fallen or been cut (Thorngrowth hint).
- **Sound:** Creak of wood, murmur of distant voices, occasional bark of laughter or call, birds circling at unusual heights.
- **Smell:** Sap, leaf, cooking fires from above; faint trace of river mist below.
- **Touch:** Slight sway as you stand on a near-root or preliminary platform; breeze cooler at this height.
- **Taste:** Crisp air; faint floral hint.

### Small Social Beat (If You Want to Start the Alula Arc)

A **gate-warden** or lower-platform ranger (maybe a cousin of Silas, or a member of the local watch) challenges them:

- They may:
  - Invoke **Riverwalker names** ("Silas Thornfoot sends regards") for easier entry.
  - Mention **Mr Tilde** (Snicket's contact) or **Theodore** to get an intrigued reaction.
  - Present the **worker letter** or Brill's note to explain they're on Haven business (which may raise suspicion).
  - **Show the lute string and antler fragment**—this gets immediate attention, especially if they mention Theodore or Brindle.

You don't have to fully run this scene—just enough to:

- Set the tone: Alula is wary but not closed.
- Tag a couple of names: a gate-warden, mention of **Elder Thorne** or **Guard-Captain Lirael** as the ones who'll decide what to do with them "tomorrow."
- **Important:** If they show the evidence, the gate-warden becomes more interested and may mention that "someone matching that description" was brought in recently, or that there's been talk of a halfling and a strange fox-creature.

### Fear Usage

Probably skip Fear here; this is a hopeful-but-tense image.

If you want one small ominous note:

- A distant platform lower in the shadows seems… wrong. Vines there hang too still, or sway in a direction different from the rest: a hint of the **Thorngrowth Spire** presence deeper in the undercanopy.

### End-of-Session Hooks

- **Immediate Next Session:**  
  - Meeting Alula’s **gate authorities**.  
  - Deciding how open to be about their connection to Haven, Fanewraith, and the Eyes.  
  - Beginning the social dance between **Council**, **rebels**, and their personal quests.

- **Threads to Carry Forward:**
  - Fianna: Theodore and Brindle were together, but something attacked them. They may be in Alula, or they may be in danger. The antler fragment suggests Brindle was injured.
  - Fern: The land's imbalance is worse here; Thorngrowth and Witherwild creeping into the canopy.
  - Gnirth: Rivers beneath Alula carry whispers similar to Tideveil's echo.
  - Sabriel: Haven's banners do not fly here; he stands on foreign ground. His former commander may be behind the Fanewraith mask.
  - Snicket: Mr Tilde, serpent coins, and undercanopy networks await.

# Travel Inserts (Modular)

Use 1–2 as needed if you’re ahead or behind schedule.

### Travel Insert A – Mutated Stag at a Distance (Atmospheric)

**Trigger:** Between Scenes 2 and 3, or between 3 and 4 if you need a beat.

- PCs spot a **stag** on a hill, antlers grown in strange, crystalline patterns, but it is **not yet hostile**.
- **Instinct / Knowledge:** Recognize it as a **Rohkin-touched creature** managing to hold corruption at bay—for now.
- Outcome:  
  - Gives Fianna an emotional beat thinking of **Brindle**.  
  - You can describe the stag looking directly at them, then trotting away toward deeper woods.

### Travel Insert B – Oove's Whisper (Omen)

**Trigger:** If Fern or Fianna asks for guidance at night camp.

- A circle of night-blooms opens around their bedroll; petals orient toward the **north-east**, roughly Alula's direction.
- Fern or Fianna may hear a faint, comforting whisper that they interpret as **Oove**:
  - "Not lost. Just late."
- Small boon: +1 to their next Instinct roll related to navigation or sensing corruption.

### Travel Insert D – Subtle Witherwild Changes (Atmospheric Escalation)

**Trigger:** Throughout travel, especially between Scenes 2-4, to show gradual corruption.

**Visible but Not Drastic Changes:**
- **Trees:** Bark patterns that look like **veins** under the surface, pulsing faintly in rhythm with heartbeat.
- **Flowers:** Some blooms have **extra petals** or **wrong colors**—a Lady's Veil flower with black streaks, a rose with thorns that curl inward.
- **Animals:** A bird with **one glassy eye** (like the crow at border), a rabbit with **bark-like patches** on its fur, fish with **too many scales** that catch light oddly.
- **Water:** Eddies that flow **backward** for a moment, bubbles that pop with a **scent of decay**.
- **Ground:** Patches of moss that **glow faintly** at wrong times, roots that seem to **shift position** when not directly observed.

**GM Notes:**
- These should feel **unsettling but not immediately threatening**.
- Builds tension without combat.
- PCs can notice and discuss, or ignore and let unease build.
- Foreshadows deeper corruption in Alula and beyond.

### Travel Insert C – Haven Patrol Ghosts (Perspective)

**Trigger:** Early in the journey if you want one last Haven echo.

- They see a small Haven patrol across the river or far along another ridge—too far to interact.
- The patrol:
  - Looks under-strength, nervous.
  - Moves away from the wild rather than into it.
- Sabriel gets to feel how far from his old lines he’s stepping; Snicket can decide if she hides or stands open.

## Additional Suggestions & Improvements

### Enhanced Character Moments

**For Fern:**
- If she bonds with the Thorn-Cake Mimic, consider having it **react to her Fungril network**—perhaps pulsing in time with her connection to Gnirth or other Fungril.
- The shrine discovery could trigger a **memory** of her grove before corruption, or a **vision** of what her grove could become if balance is restored.

**For Fianna:**
- When hearing about Theodore, add a **physical detail** she recognizes—a description of his lute, a song he played, or a mannerism.
- Consider having her **sense Brindle's presence** in the corrupted creatures they see—a moment of connection that deepens her quest.

**For Gnirth:**
- The river's "memory" of Tideveil could manifest as **water that briefly forms patterns** he doesn't recognize but feels familiar.
- If he touches the tainted ford water, consider a **micro-vision** (not full ooze vision) of submerged stones, chanting voices, but unclear.

**For Sabriel:**
- At the border stone, he might **leave a small token**—a prayer ribbon, a coin, or a piece of his old sigil—as a promise to return and protect this place.
- Consider having him **recognize a pattern** in the corruption that reminds him of Bolgin's marsh, creating internal conflict.

**For Snicket:**
- She might **spot smuggler marks** that lead to a small cache or message from Mr Tilde, giving her a head start on her Alula mission.
- Her serpent coin could **react** to something in the Hunting Grounds—perhaps a hidden shrine or marker.

### Pacing Adjustments

- **If running long:** Cut Travel Insert C (Haven Patrol Ghosts) or shorten Scene 1's social beats.
- **If running short:** Add Travel Insert D (Subtle Witherwild Changes) throughout, expand Scene 4's lore discussions, or add a small **wildlife encounter** (non-combat, like the mutated stag).

### Worldbuilding Consistency

- **Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds** fits well as a **transition zone** between Haven's order and Fanewick's wild.
- The **tainted ford** shows corruption spreading along **watercourses**—important for Gnirth's arc and world consistency.
- **Qui'Gar shrine** placement makes sense: death/renewal divinities often appear at **thresholds** (borders, rivers, crossroads).

### Session Arc Flow

1. **Reflection** (Scene 1) → Process Serpents Hope
2. **Transition** (Scene 2) → Leave Haven behind
3. **Challenge** (Scene 3) → Face first real Witherwild hazard
4. **Connection** (Scene 4) → Meet Fanewick's people, learn lore, Fern's gift
5. **Arrival** (Scene 5) → See Alula, set up next session

This creates a **breathing room → challenge → reward → arrival** structure that feels natural.

## Notes for Future Sessions

- **Alula Factions:**  
  Prepare **Elder Thorne, Mira Voss, Guard-Captain Lirael** for Session 9 intros.

- **Thorngrowth Spire:**  
  Decide how visible its effects are from the undercanopy and how soon to deploy **Thornward Vigil** or **Echoes of Thorngrowth** hooks.

- **Brindle & Rohkin:**  
  Use Riverwalker herds and Rohkin omens as on-ramps to "Brindle's Redemption"-style quests.

- **Gnirth & Tideveil:**  
  The way the river "remembers" him here should point toward an eventual return to the **Tideveil Enclave ruins**.

- **Fern's Thorn-Cake Mimic:**  
  Track its growth over sessions. Consider giving it **personality quirks** based on how Fern treats it. It could become a **moral compass** of sorts—reacting to her choices about balance, endings, and renewal.

- **Rite Clock:**  
  Decide how many in-world days to Alula's next major ritual beat. This session moves them closer; Session 9–10 can bring the Rite into sharper focus.
