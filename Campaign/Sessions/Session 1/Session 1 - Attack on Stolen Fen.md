# Daggerheart – Session 1 Notes

**Title:** _Attack on Stolen Fen_  
**Theme:** Beauty before the fall, connection, and the first hints of something twisted beneath the surface.  
**Setting:** Late Sunnar (late summer afternoon) before Nightveil falls, at the settlement of Stolen Fen—a place of quiet industry and gathering shadows.

## The Warmth Before the Storm

The air was warm with the last breath of Sunnar, the sun hanging low and spilling gold across the land, turning every shadow long and soft. The wind carried the scent of wild mint and damp earth, and somewhere far off, the slow, steady creak of wooden joints marked the work of the Clanks in the fields. Tall, deliberate shapes moved among the rows of white flowers, their metal frames glinting in the light. The flowers swayed like a pale tide, their petals catching the sun as if they were made of silk. Beyond them, the land dipped into the darker greens and browns of the Stolen Fen—a place where the air grew heavy, and the ground remembered every step.

It was a beautiful day, but there was a weight to it—the kind of stillness that comes before something changes.

## Converging Paths

### Stolen Fen Settlement

The settlement of Stolen Fen sat on stilts above the marshy ground, its wooden walkways creaking underfoot. Rope bridges connected low buildings, and the market square bustled with traders, Clank overseers, and locals carrying baskets of white flowers. The air smelled of peat smoke and drying herbs.

**Sabriel's Path.** From the edge of the fields, Sabriel saw Captain Thorne—broad-shouldered, weathered, his faded Haven coat hanging open. The old friend caught his eye and beckoned him over. Thorne had taken to drink, his voice gruff and low, but he wanted to talk about the lay of the land, to open up. Yet Sabriel, caught up in his travels to Monks Eliegh, declined to stay long. The conversation was brief, heavy with things left unsaid.

**Snicket's Path.** In the market square, Delilah Goldtooth—tall, broad, with gold-capped tusks and a bright scarf—waved Snicket over. She was sorting bundles of dried herbs, her eyes sharp and knowing. Snicket spoke with her around the market, and Delilah tasked her with delivering a small package to a shelled creature, a Galapa called Mr Tilde in Alula. Payment on delivery. The arrangement felt like business as usual, but there was something more beneath the surface—a trust built on years of careful transactions.

### The Border Brush

Meanwhile, in the undergrowth at the border, the air was damp and cool. Shafts of sunlight cut through the canopy, catching on the white blooms that grew even this far from the fields. The hum of insects was constant, rising and falling like a strange chorus.

**Fern and Fianna's Journey.** Fern and Fianna had been traveling for a few cycles at this point, seeking Brindle, Fianna's companion who had succumbed to a virulent virus that had been attacking wildlife and fauna deep in the Witherwilds, causing a blackening of the body and a change of the mind. Through the Fungril network, Fern felt a sudden, sharp tingle—a twisted power, familiar yet wrong. At first, she thought it was her companion, but it wasn't. The sensation was close, disturbing.

Fianna noticed a patch of flowers with petals curled inward, as if recoiling from something unseen—a small sign of imbalance that spoke to her deeper connection with nature.

**Gnirth's Discovery.** Alone in the brush, Gnirth felt the warped hum of the Fungril network—and another presence drawing closer. It stirred something deep and uneasy in him. When Fern linked onto the connection of a being close by that was disturbed, following it led them both to come across Gnirth, alone in the thicket. After some talking, they decided it would be best to travel together, as Gnirth had no memories of events from his past—a blank slate that both intrigued and worried his newfound companions.

## Convergence at the Settlement

The rope bridges and wooden walkways of Stolen Fen came into view as the travelers approached. The scent of peat smoke mixed with the sweet tang of white flowers. In the market square, Sabriel and Snicket spotted three figures approaching from the brush—two travelers and a lone Fungril.

Before greetings could be exchanged, they heard it—a low vibration in the air, like the sound of a bow drawn across a giant string. It grew louder, sharper, until it was joined by the frantic splashing of feet in shallow water.

## The Bloodwing Attack

From between the reeds, they saw them—three teenagers, faces pale with fear, running toward the settlement. Behind them, the air shimmered with movement: long, needle-like proboscises, glistening wings, and bodies the size of hounds. The Bloodwings were almost on them.

As they attempted to gain entry to town, two guards turned them away as strangers who should stay in the forest. Sabriel walked up behind them, but ignored the quarry and walked ahead. At the same time, the teenagers' screams split the air as they came out of the woods, followed by five Bloodwings.

Sabriel, close by as he continued his pilgrimage, jumped into action and dove into the swarm to inflict severe damage across the giant bugs. The others followed suit, their weapons finding purchase in the chitinous hides. One of the creatures was ripped apart, save the head, which fell to the ground with a wet thud.

Pheromones leaked into the woods—a cry for help that was heard as another two Bloodwings fell to the ground. The earth rumbled beneath their feet, and from the depths emerged two more Bloodwings and their Queen, her massive form rising from the fen like a nightmare given form.

A fraught battle took place, the air thick with the hum of wings and the stench of ichor. The party fought with desperate determination, protecting the teens who huddled behind them, their weapons flashing in the late afternoon sun. But in the end, it was an improvised incendiary attack that turned the tide—fire consuming the final bugs, their wings catching like paper and their bodies collapsing into ash.

## Aftermath and Acceptance

The last of the Bloodwings fell or fled, the hum fading into the distance. The teenagers were shaken but alive, clutching each other and thanking the party breathlessly. Captain Thorne strode over, clapping Sabriel on the shoulder with a mixture of relief and something darker—gratitude tinged with the knowledge that this was only the beginning.

Due to the battle and the helping of the teens, the party gained entry to the town and sought shelter in the local inn—The Last Coil—owned by the barkeep, Tom Yarug.

Tom was a local Elf, but more importantly, a survivor of the war effort on Haven's side. Not seeing the front line, he had given shelter, food, and drink to those that needed it, for both sides. He preferred not to talk about what happened, though he would be an ear for those that needed to talk—a quiet presence in a world that had seen too much.

The party sold some bits from the battle, and after a critical success of dialogue exchange, Snicket bargained for multiple handfuls of gold, more than enough for the party to stay for a week. The coins felt warm in their hands, a small victory in a world that seemed determined to test them.

Fianna heard that others that matched her grove might have been seen heading towards the barracks. As this was on the way to Monks Eliegh, it sounded like this was the likely direction the party would be taking very soon. There was a traveling cart heading there in a few days that they could travel with for support.

The party took a long rest that covered the few days, the settlement repairing the damage, the Clanks returning to their work, and the hum in the air fading… but not vanishing. They had each found reasons to linger in Stolen Fen—whether for business, duty, or curiosity. The weight of what was coming hung in the air like smoke, but for now, there was rest.

The session ended there, the first threads of their story beginning to weave together under the last light of Sunnar.
