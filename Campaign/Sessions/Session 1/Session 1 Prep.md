# **Daggerheart – Session 1 Notes

**Title:** *The Last Light of Sunnar*  
**Theme:** Beauty before the fall, connection, and the first hints of something twisted beneath the surface.  
**Setting:** Late [[Day and Night|Sunnar]] (late summer afternoon) before [[Day and Night|Nightveil]] falls.

---

## **Title Card**

> *“The afternoon knows what the morning never suspected.”*  
> — Robert Frost  

---

## **Scene 1 – Opening Narration**

> **The air is warm with the last breath of Sunnar.**  
> The sun hangs low, spilling gold across the land, turning every shadow long and soft. The wind carries the scent of wild mint and damp earth, and somewhere far off, the slow, steady creak of wooden joints marks the work of the Clanks in the fields.  
>  
> You see them — tall, deliberate shapes moving among the rows of white flowers, their metal frames glinting in the light. The flowers sway like a pale tide, their petals catching the sun as if they were made of silk. Beyond them, the land dips into the darker greens and browns of the Stolen Fen — a place where the air grows heavy, and the ground remembers every step you take.  
>  
> It is a beautiful day, but there’s a weight to it — the kind of stillness that comes before something changes.

---

## **Scene 2 – Split Start**

### **2A – Stolen Fen Settlement**

> The settlement of Stolen Fen sits on stilts above the marshy ground, its wooden walkways creaking underfoot. Rope bridges connect low buildings, and the market square bustles with traders, Clank overseers, and locals carrying baskets of white flowers. The air smells of peat smoke and drying herbs.

---

**Sabriel’s Beat – Captain Thorne**
> From the edge of the fields, you see Captain Thorne — broad-shouldered, weathered, his faded Haven coat hanging open. He catches your eye and beckons you over.  
>  
> **Thorne (gruff, low voice):** “Arden. Good to see you. You’ve got that look — the one that says you’re about to tell me something’s wrong before I’ve had my morning tea.”  

**Prompts:**
- Thorne asks Sabriel to keep an eye on the market while he checks the perimeter.  
- He mentions Clanks have been “pausing mid-row, like they’re listening to something.”  
- He warns: “Quiet’s good… until it isn’t.”

---

**Snicket’s Beat – Delilah Goldtooth**
> In the market square, Delilah Goldtooth — tall, broad, with gold-capped tusks and a bright scarf — waves you over. She’s sorting bundles of dried herbs, her eyes sharp.  
>  
> **Delilah (warm but sly):** “Snicket! I was wondering when you’d crawl out of the shadows. Got something for you — but it’s not for the faint of heart.”  

**Prompts:**
- She offers a small, wrapped package to deliver discreetly.  
- She shares gossip: “Fishermen say there’s a shadow in the water. Big enough to scare the dragonflies away.”  
- She mentions Samson with a bittersweet smile: “He’d have loved this place. All the wrong kinds of opportunity.”

### **2B – Border Brush**

> The undergrowth is thick here, the air damp and cool. Shafts of sunlight cut through the canopy, catching on the white blooms that grow even this far from the fields. The hum of insects is constant, rising and falling like a strange chorus.

---

**Fern’s Beat:**
> Through the Fungril network, you feel a sudden, sharp tingle — a twisted power, familiar yet wrong. At first, you think it’s your companion… but it’s not. The sensation is close.  

**Fianna’s Beat:**
> Walking beside Fern, you notice a small sign of imbalance — a patch of flowers with petals curled inward, as if recoiling from something unseen.  

**Gnirth’s Beat:**
> Alone in the brush, you feel the warped hum of the Fungril network — and another presence drawing closer. It stirs something deep and uneasy in you.

---

**GM Prompt:**  
Let Fern & Gnirth roleplay their recognition — tension, curiosity, mistrust. Fianna can mediate or observe. Then, they head toward the settlement.

---

## **Scene 3 – Convergence**
**GM Read-Aloud:**
> The rope bridges and wooden walkways of Stolen Fen come into view. The scent of peat smoke mixes with the sweet tang of white flowers. In the market square, Sabriel and Snicket spot three figures approaching from the brush — two travellers and a lone Fungril.

---

## **Scene 4 – The Hum**
**GM Read-Aloud:**
> Before greetings can be exchanged, you hear it — a low vibration in the air, like the sound of a bow drawn across a giant string. It grows louder, sharper, until it’s joined by the frantic splashing of feet in shallow water.

---

## **Scene 5 – Inciting Incident: Bloodwing Attack**
**GM Read-Aloud:**
> From between the reeds, you see them — three teenagers, faces pale with fear, running toward the settlement. Behind them, the air shimmers with movement: long, needle-like proboscises, glistening wings, and bodies the size of hounds. The Bloodwings are almost on them.

---

```encounter

party:  Main Party

  - 5:Giant Mosquitoes
  -

```

**Combat Notes:**
- **Enemies:** 1 Bloodwing per 2 PCs (2–3 total).  
- **Objectives:** Protect the teens, drive off the Bloodwings.  
- **Battlefield:** Shallow water (difficult terrain), reed cover, fallen log for elevation.  
- **Weakness:** Fire, smoke, loud noise cause retreat.  

---

## **Scene 6 – Aftermath**
**GM Read-Aloud:**
> The last of the Bloodwings falls or flees, the hum fading into the distance. The teenagers are shaken but alive, clutching each other and thanking you breathlessly. Captain Thorne strides over, clapping Sabriel on the shoulder.  
>  
> **Thorne:** “Looks like you were in the right place at the right time. Drinks are on me tonight.”

---

## **Scene 7 – Small Time Jump**
**GM Read-Aloud:**
> The next few days pass in a blur. The settlement repairs the damage, the Clanks return to their work, and the hum in the air fades… but doesn’t vanish. You’ve each found reasons to linger in Stolen Fen — whether for business, duty, or curiosity.  

---

## **Scene 8 – Kreil’s Note**

### **GM Notes for Delivery**

- The note is slipped into **Snicket’s pocket** by a bump in the barracks yard.
- If the players question who did it, they’ll only see a **hooded figure vanishing into the crowd**.
- If they show the note to others, **locals will deny knowledge** — reinforcing the secrecy.

>[!note] 
>“The roots are stirring, and the waters carry their poison. What you saw in the fen was only the first breath. 
>
>Things are in motion that need to be stopped.
>
>Meet me at the Old Weir before next Nightfall. Bring only those you trust. — K.”


## **Sigil on the Note**

- A **coin with a serpent biting its tail**, half-faded.
- In smuggling circles, it means _“trusted contact.”_
- Snicket would recognize it immediately.
- To others, it’s just a strange doodle.

---

## **Scene 9 – End of Session**
**GM Prompt:**  
Let the group discuss whether to go, who Kreil might be, and what “the roots are stirring” means. End on the decision to set out — or a cliffhanger as the first signs of Nightveil begin to fall.
