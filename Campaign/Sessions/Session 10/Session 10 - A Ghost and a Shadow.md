# Daggerheart – Session 10 Notes

**Title:** _A Ghost and a Shadow_  
**Theme:** Trust and betrayal in the canopy—old allies surface in the dark, and the line between rescue and ruin narrows to a blade's edge.  
**Setting:** The session opens in [[Elowen]]'s hidden cottage and moves between the scholars' tree and the twisted prison in [[Alula]], as the party splits to find Theodore and uncover the Fanewraith's web before Sunnar's dawn.

## Elowen's Counsel

The session opened in [[Elowen]]'s hut, the air still warm with the smell of hearty stew and the peace of a place untouched by the Witherwild's worst. [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] and [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] spoke with her before leaving, gathering what might serve them in the days ahead.

She told them of council members she had known in better times—[[Elder Corin]], [[Elder Mirra]], and [[Elder Kaelen]]—who might still be of use to those who knew how to ask. Of [[Fanewraith|Elara Voss]], the woman the world now called the Fanewraith, she offered a sliver of the past: Elara had been drawn to the faint divinities from a young age and had always shown a strong connection to them. That hunger had not faded; it had twisted.

She also shared what she knew of the executions. Two signatures were required for a sentence to be carried out—one from the council of elders, the other from the guard corps. There might be a way to alter the document, she suggested, and so spare [[Theodore Underbrush|Theodore]] the noose. She did not know where Elara was now, only that she came and went like a shadow. With that, the two had what they needed to step back into the world above.

## The Market in the Treetops

Back in the treetops of Alula, [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]], [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]], and [[Gnirth]] made their way toward the market. High above, a finer platform caught the light; below, the main space spread like an amphitheatre, with the hangman's noose at its focus—eight feet high, surrounded by guards. Market stalls of average price crowded the walkways, and wanted posters were everywhere: charcoal sketches of a halfling, an orc, and others, defaced with graffiti that named them traitors, liars, thieves.

Fianna drew Snicket aside. The halfling on the poster was her father. They agreed to learn what he was accused of.

The market offered Ironside Forge, the Enchanted Emporium, Healer's Hearth, and the Traveller's Trove, among others. In the Enchanted Emporium, a small elven creature tended the wares. She had an arcane prism that, when rubbed, granted those nearby a keener edge to their spellcasting until the next long rest, a Valor Stone that raised the damage threshold of whoever held it until rest, and an improved wand. The prism cost a handful of gold; Snicket bartered it down to three. She asked after the halfling's bounty—whether it was still available. If his name had been written on the posters as captured, the keeper said, he would already be in their hands.

At the blacksmith, a strong female dwarf with a surprisingly high voice showed them improved weapons and a gem that looked like a misty orb—attune it to a blade, she said, and it would grant the bearer the power to reroll a weapon attack on a one or a two. At the Traveller's Trove, a young faun-like creature minded the stall: general travelling gear, old gloves, keys, lockets. Notable among the wares was a Gecko Glove for three gold, allowing the wearer to cling to surfaces. They did not visit Healer's Hearth.

In time they returned to the Enchanted Emporium and bought the prism, Snicket securing the price at three gold. Then a civilian tripped over Gnirth—invisible and hiding—and the commotion drew the guards. The party slipped away as the patrol moved in their direction.

## Religion and Rendezvous

Elsewhere, Sabriel and Fern had decided to return to the tavern to meet the others; they could not speak safely over the Fungril network. On the way they spoke of religion and the source of Fanewick's powers. Fern spoke of her own faith; Sabriel suggested that learning where Elara and Elowen had come from, and which faint divinity Elara served, might reveal when to strike or how to weaken her. He went further: perhaps they could strike at Elara's god. Fern told him he ought to get some sleep, then reached for Gnirth through the network and sent a simple signal—a two, and an L. Gnirth replied: *return to sender*. She sent back: *Rendezvous*.

## The Noose and the Whisper

Snicket, Fianna, and Gnirth made for the inn. As they passed the hangman's rope, they took stock: three guards stood near the noose, with two more watching from a distance. Gnirth felt a tingling sensation and focused on the liquid being applied to the rope—thick, not water or common oil. It reminded him of the tar from the marsh.

Around them, people whispered. They were talking about Fianna's father. He had sold secrets to Haven, they said.

---

## Reunion and the Split

They met again at the inn. There was a brief muddle over Fern's coded description, then they shared what they had learned and weighed their choices. The plan crystallised: Sabriel and Gnirth would go to the council and the scholars; Snicket, Fern, and Fianna would go to the dungeons.

---

## Into the Earth

Snicket, Fern, and Fianna followed [[Elowen]]'s mole companion, Demetrius, down the path he had dug. They spoke to him as they went. When the way was clear, the mole wished them luck and disappeared back into the earth.

## The Twisted Tree

They emerged from the tunnels in the shadow of the corrupted tree—eighty feet or more of tainted growth above them, thorns as long as a forearm. The bustle of the village overhead was winding down into the dark. No guards waited below.

Fern flew up to the windows to see what lay inside. The bars were tainted; she could not make out anyone within. A single entrance led into the prison from above, heavily guarded. As a druid, Fianna took the form of a hummingbird and flew into the cells. In one she found a young boy, malnourished and still. Fern gave him a little cake; his eyes opened, he screamed, and she drew back and hid.

Fianna flitted from room to room until she saw what she had come for: a man chained to the wall, and a bundle of fur in the corner. She flew to him and hummed the song they had once shared. "Dad," she said, "it's me… Fianna." A light returned to his eyes.

She explained everything. Theodore told her he had left in anger, seeking revenge, and had met [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]], who had spoken of the Fanewraith. He had found [[Brindle]] in the woods—already turned by the corruption, tearing into his mate. He had had to put Brindle down. But he had a secret, he said. "Let me introduce you to Brindle's daughter, Faith"

## The Scholars' Tree

Sabriel and Gnirth made their way up to the council and scholars' tree by the lift they had learned of earlier. They approached the desk with confidence. The scholar there was [[Elder Corin]]—charismatic, academic, his robes and bearing those of a man who belonged among the archives. He was suspicious from the start and did not respond to Sabriel's attempts at subtlety. Sabriel wrote Elowen's name on a scrap of paper, then crumpled it. Corin said, "Come with me." They followed.

He led them into a room lined with circular bookcases and ladders, stairs spiralling up the outside of the trunk. Near the top they entered a chamber; the door closed behind them with a hum of magic—nothing could pass in or out.

Sabriel told him that Kreil had put them in touch with Elowen, who had told them to find Corin. They wanted to stop the Fanewraith, Elara Voss. He gave Corin the basics they knew about Bolgin, and that Bolgin was alive on the ethereal plane. He asked for guidance on how to deal with Bolgin. Corin spoke of how the flowers grew only in Fanewick. One person on the council could speak to Bolgin and the ethereal plane, he said; he did not feel easy discussing it, but he would send for her.

Sabriel asked about the tainted tree. Corin said it had come from the corruption and had never been part of Alula. It had arrived as a treant after Bolgin was killed. There were reports of an explosion around the time of Bolgin's death. Gnirth asked exactly where. Corin said there were maps in the archive and that he might know someone who had been involved. He claimed to know nothing of Fern's grove or of Theodore—only that Theo was a traitor. When Sabriel and Gnirth pressed him on what Theodore had done, Corin said he had given secrets to Haven. Sabriel said, "I'm from Haven. You're talking to me. Does that not make you a traitor?"

Corin's answer was cold. "No. It makes you a fly caught in a web."

A bang sounded at the door. As it opened, Sabriel drove his blade into Corin.

---

## A Voice from the Past

As Sabriel drew the sword from Corin's body, the door closed behind the figure who had struck it. A knight. The figure stopped. A woman's voice cut through the silence.

"Sabriel. You haven't changed one bit."

The session ended there—with Theodore found and a secret waiting in a bundle of fur, and with Sabriel and Gnirth facing a voice from the past in a sealed room high above Alula.
