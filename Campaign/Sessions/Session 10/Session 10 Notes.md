Session Title: Ghost of the Past.


The session opened up in [[Elowen|Elowen Voss]] hut, with [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] and [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] talking before they leave. She tells the two of them about some of the council members that she knew a while ago, they might be of some help. [[Elder Corin]], [[Elder Mirra]] and [[Elder Kaelen]]. [[Campaign/NPCs/Fanewraith|Elara Voss]] is interested in the faint divinities from a young age and has shown a strong connection with them.
She also goes into the details of what she knew of these executions, that it required two signatures to go through, one from the council of elders, and the other from the guard corps. Potential to alter the document somehow to avoid the execution of [[Theodore Underbrush|Theodore]]
She doesnt know where Elara is, only that she comes and goes.
