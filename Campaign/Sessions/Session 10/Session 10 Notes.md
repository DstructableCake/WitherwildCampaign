Session Title: Ghost of the Past.


The session opened up in [[Elowen|Elowen Voss]] hut, with [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] and [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] talking before they leave. She tells the two of them about some of the council members that she knew a while ago, they might be of some help. [[Elder Corin]], [[Elder Mirra]] and [[Elder Kaelen]]. [[Campaign/NPCs/Fanewraith|Elara Voss]] is interested in the faint divinities from a young age and has shown a strong connection with them.
She also goes into the details of what she knew of these executions, that it required two signatures to go through, one from the council of elders, and the other from the guard corps. Potential to alter the document somehow to avoid the execution of [[Theodore Underbrush|Theodore]]
She doesnt know where Elara is, only that she comes and goes.
Back to the treetops of [[Alula]], Fianna Snicket and Gnirth are headed towards the market. We notice high up above there is a more fancy platform. The main platform is like an ampitheatre with the hangmans noose as the focus. 8 ft high, surrounded by guards. Lot of marketstalls of average prices. Watned posters everywhere with charcoal sketch of a halfling, orc, etc. covered in insulting grafiti, calling them traitors, liars, thieves etc. Fianna tells snicket the poster of the halfling is her father, suggesting to her they find out what he is accused of doing.
Shops: Ironside forge, enchanted emporium, healers heath and travellers trove, amongst others.
In the enchanted emporium, is a small elven creature. She has an arcane prism which if you rub it, gives +1 spellcast rolls to people nearby, resets on long rest. Valor store increases damage threshold for person holding it until long rest. Improved wand. The prism costs a handful of gold, bartered down to 3. Snicket asks about the halflings bounty and whether is is still available. If written on them they would have been captured. 
The party then goes to the blacksmith who is a strong dwarf with a high voice - a female dwarf. She has several improved weapons and a gem wihc looks like a misty orb. If attune and attach it to a weapon, it will give the powerful feature which lets you reroll a weapon attack roll on a 1 or 2.
Travellers trove is staffed by a young faun like creature at the stall. The wares are general travelling things, old gloves, various keys, lockets. Of note is a Gecko glove, costing 3 gold pieces, allowing the person to stick to various surfaces.
Healers Hearth, they dont go to.
After some time, they go back to the enchanted emporium and buy the arcane prism, snicket barters the price down to the 3 gold. A Civillian tripped over Gnirth (who was invisible and hiding) and alerted the guards with the commotion. They started to head in the parties general direction.
Back to Sabriel and Fern, they decide to go back tot he tavern to meet the others as they cant communicate safetly via the fungril network at the moment. Sabriel and fern discuss religion and where fanewicks peoples powers come from. Fern explains her religian, Sabriel suggests it might be helpful to find out where Elara and Elowyn were from, as figuring out which faint divinity she worshps might help them figure out when to atttack or how to affect her powers. 
Sabriel suggests killing Elaras god. Fern says Sabriel should have a nap, then connects to Gnirth and flashes him a 2 and a L shape. Gnirth messages back 'return to sender'. Fern messages 'Rendevous'.
Snicket, Fianna and Gnirth head back to the inn. They they pass the hangmans rope, they see there are 3 guards around the noose with 2 further watching from afar. Gnirth gets a tingling sensation and picks up on the liquid going onto the rope is thick. Not water or liqui, similar tar to the marsh.
People around them are whispering, talking about Fiannas father saying he sold secrets to Haven.
They all meet back at the inn, after a brief confusion with ferns discription that was coded. We all exhange information and discuss options, deciding Sabriel and Gnirth will go to the council/ scholars while snicket, fern and gnirth will go to the dungeons.
They followed Demetrius down the path he had dug, talking to him, the mole wished them luck and disappeared into the earth.
Emerging from the underground tunnels in the shadow of the corrupted tree, reaching 80+ ft above them, the bustle of the village overhead winding down in the dark. The tainted thorns are long as a forearm. No guards down below. Fern flies up to the windows to see what is through them. The bars are tainted. Cant make out anyone inside. One entrance only into the prison up top heavily guarded. As a druid, Fianna turned into a hummingbird and fly into a various cells. Theres a young boy who is malnourished. Fern gives the boy some cake, he opens his eyes and screams, flying back out and hiding.
Sabirel and Gnirth are making their way up to the council/ scholars tree via the lift they were made aware of previously. They go to the scholars first, walking up to the desk confidently. Its Scholar Corin, who is suspicious and doesnt understant Sabriels attempts at subtlety. Sabriel writes Elowyns name on a paper and then crumples it. Corin says to 'come with me' and Sabriel and Gnirth follow. Goes to room with circular bookcases and ladders, which have stairs spuralling on the outside of them going up the trunk. Near the top of the tree, they go into a room, the door closing behind them with a hum of magic so nothing can get in and out ofb the room.
Sabriel tells him that Kreil put them in touch with Elowyn who told them to find Corin. Told him they want to stop the [[SRD Main/adversaries/Fanewraith|Fanewraith]] Elara Voss. Told him the basics about Bolgin, which they knew. Told him Bolgin is alive on the ethereal plane. Asked for guidance about how to deal with Bolgin, Corin about how the flowers only grow in Fanewick. He says one person in the council could give info on Bolgin and the ethereal plane, doesnt feel comfortable talking about it but he will call for her.
Sabriel asks about the tainted tree, Corin says it was from the corruption but was never part of Alula originally. As a treant, it arrived after Bolgin was killed. They have reports of an explosion aroudn the time of Bolgins death. Gnirth asks exactly where it was, Corin says there are maps in the archive and he mmight know someone who was behind it. Doesnt know anything about Ferns grove, or Theo, says Theo is a traitor. Sabriel and Gnirth asks what Theo did, Corin says he gave secrets to Haven. Sabriel says 'Im from Haven' and you're talking to me, does that not make you a traitor?
A bang at the door is heard, Corin says 'No, it makes you a fly caught in a web'. As the door opens, Sabriel stabs Corin.
Back at the tree, Fianna keeps flittering into various rooms until she sees a man chained to the wall and a bundle of fur inthe corner. She flew over to him and hummed her song they once shared, saying to him 'Dad, its me....Fianna'. A light came back into his eyes on hearing this. Fianna explains everything to Theo who says he left to get revenge in anger, met Kreil who told him about the Fnewraith. He said he found Brindle in the woods, he was already turned by the corruption, tearing into his mate that he had. He unfortunately had to put Brindle down. But he had a secret, and said 'let me introduce you to Brindles daughter, '
Back at the scholars chamber, as Sabriel removes the sword from from Corins body, the door closes shut behind the mysterious person. This person, a knight, stops. and says "Sabriel, you havent changed one bit". A female voice.
End of session cliffhanger.
