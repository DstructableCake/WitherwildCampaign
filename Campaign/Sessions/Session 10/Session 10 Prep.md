# Session 10: The Dawn of Judgment

**Title:** *Roots and Ropes*  
**Theme:** Time running out, hidden truths, and impossible choices—in Alula, every branch has eyes, and dawn brings judgment.  
**Setting:** The treetop village of Alula, divided between traditionalists and rebels, with Theodore Underbrush's execution scheduled for dawn tomorrow. The party is split: Sabriel and Fern in tunnels returning from Elowen's hovel, while Snicket, Gnirth, and Fianna are heading toward the twisted vine tree where prisoners are kept.

---

## Session Overview

### The Situation
- **Time Remaining:** Approximately 24 hours until dawn (Sunnar) and Theodore's scheduled execution
- **Party Split:** 
  - **Group A (Tunnels):** Sabriel and Fern, following Demetrius through underground passages back toward Alula
  - **Group B (Thorn Tree):** Snicket, Gnirth, and Fianna, heading toward the twisted vine tree where prisoners are kept
- **Key Objective:** Save Theodore Underbrush from execution, uncover the truth about his "treason," and navigate the complex political landscape of Alula

### Time Management
- **Real-world timers** create pressure: 20-minute windows for infiltration, 10-minute countdowns at critical moments
- **Time delays** between split party actions allow for dramatic reveals and parallel storylines
- **Fail-forward mechanics** ensure the story advances even if the party fails—Theodore may die, but the consequences drive future sessions

### Seeding Story Beats Without Giving Them Away
- **Scene 1 (Gallows Tree):** Public notices appear naturally as the party explores; guards mention "tomorrow's spectacle" in casual conversation
- **Scene 2 (Mask in Mirror):** Only triggers if Sabriel is identified or goes to Sun-Lofts—unlikely given his disguise, but can be seeded through rumors of "recovered Stone Serpent gear"
- **Scene 3 (Second Voice):** Rumors about "two signatures needed" can be overheard in taverns or from sympathetic NPCs
- **Scene 4 (Council):** Only triggers when party has evidence—let them discover what counts as evidence through investigation
- **Scene 5 (Prison):** Natural destination if party seeks to visit Theodore—guards mention "visiting hours" or restrictions
- **Scene 6 (Gallows):** The inevitable conclusion if other paths fail—dawn arrives, execution proceeds

## Part 1: The Return Journey

### Group A: Sabriel and Fern in the Tunnels

**Location:** Underground passage from Elowen's hovel back toward Alula

#### Scene Description
The tunnel Demetrius dug stretches for hundreds of meters through earth and root. The air is cool and damp, the walls rough-hewn by the mole's patient claws. The passage is narrow—requiring crawling for most of the journey—but stable. Bioluminescent fungi provide faint, shifting light that makes shadows dance along the walls.

**Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic but purposeful. The tunnel feels like a secret path, a way to move unseen beneath the city's watchful eyes. Every sound echoes, making stealth difficult but not impossible.

#### Key Details
- **Distance:** Approximately 300-400 meters from Elowen's hovel to the exit point near Alula's lower levels
- **Travel Time:** 15-20 minutes of real-world time (crawling pace)
- **Exit Point:** Emerges near the Shadowreach district, close to the twisted vine tree but not directly at it
- **Connection Status:** Fern's Fungril network connection may still be blocked or intermittent—test this as they travel

#### Encounters & Events

**1. The Blocked Connection**
- Fern attempts to reach Gnirth through the Fungril network
- **Result:** Connection is weak or blocked—she can sense the others are alive but cannot communicate clearly
- **Description:** "The network feels... muffled. Like trying to hear through thick cloth. You sense movement, life, but words won't form. Something is interfering with the connection."
- **Purpose:** Creates tension, prevents easy coordination between split parties

**2. The Wither-Touched Section**
- Partway through, the tunnel passes through an area where Witherwild corruption has seeped into the roots
- **Description:** "The roots here are darker, twisted. Small thorns protrude from the walls, and the air tastes of decay. Demetrius moves more cautiously here, his claws scraping against corrupted wood."
- **Challenge:** Agility DC 12 to avoid thorns, or take 1 HP damage
- **Purpose:** Reminds players of the corruption, creates minor obstacle

**3. The Exit**
- The tunnel emerges in a small grove of twisted trees, hidden from direct view of Alula's platforms
- **Description:** "The tunnel opens into a small clearing surrounded by gnarled trees. Above, you can see the platforms of Alula's lower levels—the Shadowreach district. Rope bridges sway in the breeze, and you can hear distant voices, but you're well-hidden here."
- **Options:**
  - Head directly toward the twisted vine tree (where Group B is heading)
  - Try to reconnect with Group B through the network
  - Seek information about the execution plans
  - Look for signs of the "Hanging Hollow" mentioned in rumors

#### NPCs Present
- **Demetrius (Elowen's Mole):** Silent guide, will wait at the exit point or can be sent back to Elowen with a message

#### Items of Interest
- None in the tunnel itself, but the exit point provides a hidden staging area

#### Talking Points & Hooks
- **"The tunnel feels safe, but you know the city above is watching. Every branch has eyes."**
- **"You can see the twisted vine tree in the distance—a massive, thorn-ridden structure that seems to pulse with dark energy."**
- **"The air here is cleaner than in the city proper. Elowen's sanctuary truly is untouched by the corruption."**

## Part 2: The Hanging Hollow (Group B's First Stop)

### Group B: Snicket, Gnirth, and Fianna Arrive at the Hanging Hollow

**Location:** Tree 2A - The Hanging Hollow (Heartwalk, 100-200ft) - Mid-level plaza, natural amphitheatre

> [!NOTE] DM Note
> Group B must pass through the Hanging Hollow on their way to the twisted vine tree. This is their first encounter with the execution preparations and creates immediate urgency.

#### Sensory Description

**Sight:**
- Wide mid-level platform forming a natural amphitheatre where several massive branches converge around a central tree trunk
- A crude wooden execution platform has been erected in the center, approximately 8 feet high, with rough-hewn steps leading up
- A single rope dangles from a branch 30 feet above, blackened and charred from past executions—it pulses faintly with dark energy
- Four thorn-pillars stand at the corners of the platform, each carved with symbols of Qui'Gar and Hyacynis
- Two Thorn Guards stand watch at the base of the platform, their armor wreathed in living thorns
- Above, on hidden ledges in the surrounding branches, you catch glimpses of movement—archers with bows ready
- Hand-drawn wanted posters are nailed to nearby trees and posts:
  - **Theodore's Poster:** Crude charcoal sketch of a halfling with a lute, the word "TRAITOR-THORN" scrawled in red ink below, "WANTED FOR TREASON - EXECUTION AT DAWN"
  - **Other Posters:** Two more showing different faces—a human man and a halfling woman, both marked "TRAITOR"
- Workers are making final preparations: reinforcing the platform, testing the trap-door mechanism, checking the rope
- A small crowd has gathered—refugees, workers, curious onlookers—watching the preparations with mixed expressions
- Market stalls around the perimeter have been pushed back, creating a clear viewing area
- Shrines to various Faint Divinities ring the space, their candles flickering in the breeze

**Sound:**
- The murmur of the gathered crowd—whispers, hushed conversations, the occasional sob
- The creak of the gallows rope as it sways in the wind
- The thud of hammers as workers reinforce the platform
- Guards' boots on wooden planks, their armor clinking softly
- The snap of the trap-door being tested—a sharp, final sound
- Distant city sounds: rope bridges creaking, voices from other platforms, the general hum of Alula
- A child crying somewhere in the crowd
- The whisper of wind through the branches above

**Smell:**
- The scent of old rope, charred and treated with something acrid
- Fresh-cut wood from the platform construction
- The metallic tang of fear—sweat, anxiety, dread
- Incense from the surrounding shrines, mixed with the smell of night blooms
- The faint, sickly-sweet odor of decay from the blackened rope
- Crowd scents: unwashed refugees, workers, the general smell of a gathering

**Touch:**
- The rough wooden planks of the viewing area underfoot
- The platform sways slightly with the movement of the crowd
- A cold breeze at this height, carrying the promise of coming dawn
- The sense of dread that seems to press down on the space
- Rough bark of the trees where posters are nailed
- Cold metal of the trap-door mechanism visible beneath the platform

**Taste:**
- Metallic tension in the air—fear made tangible
- Dust from the construction work
- The bitter taste of dread and anticipation

**Atmosphere:** Public and exposed. This is a place meant for spectacle, for sending messages. The air feels heavy with anticipation and dread. Every detail speaks of finality, of judgment, of the city's harsh justice.

#### Key Details
- **Public Notices:** Posted on several trees and platforms throughout Alula
  - **Text:** "TRAITOR-THORN THEODORE UNDERBRUSH TO HANG AT DAWN TOMORROW"
  - **Image:** Crude charcoal drawing of a halfling with a lute
  - **Location:** The Hanging Hollow
  - **Signed:** "By order of the Masked Commander and the Elder Council"
- **Wanted Posters:** Hand-drawn, crude but clear
  - **Theodore's Poster:** Shows halfling with lute, "TRAITOR-THORN" in red ink
  - **Other Posters:** Two additional "traitors" also scheduled for execution
- **Security:** 
  - 2 Thorn Guards always present at base of platform
  - 2-3 Watchers on hidden ledges above (archers with bows)
  - Additional guards may arrive as dawn approaches
- **Timing:** Execution scheduled for dawn (Sunnar), approximately 24 hours from now
- **The Rope:** Wither-blessed, blackened by past executions, pulses with dark energy
- **The Platform:** Trap-door mechanism, currently being tested and reinforced

#### Encounters & Events

**1. First Sight of the Posters**
- As Group B approaches the Hanging Hollow, they see the wanted posters
- **Fianna's Reaction:** "That's... that's my father. They're going to kill him tomorrow."
- **Description:** "The poster is crudely drawn but unmistakable. A halfling with a lute, his features rough but recognizable. The word 'TRAITOR-THORN' is scrawled in what looks like red ink—or blood. Below it: 'WANTED FOR TREASON - EXECUTION AT DAWN'."
- **Fear Die Trigger:** If Fianna sees this, consider rolling Fear die (DC 12) - the realization that her father is scheduled to die tomorrow
- **Other Posters:** Two more show different faces—a human man and another halfling. All marked for execution.

**2. Observing the Preparations**
- Party can observe the area from a distance or approach closer
- **Description:** "Workers are making final preparations. One tests the trap-door mechanism—it snaps open with a sharp crack, then closes. Another checks the rope, running his hands along its length. The rope itself seems to pulse with dark energy, and you notice the worker's hands are wrapped in protective cloth. Two Thorn Guards stand watch, their eyes scanning the crowd. Above, you catch glimpses of movement—archers on hidden ledges, their bows ready."
- **Information Gained:**
  - Security is tight—direct assault would be suicide
  - The rope is dangerous—Wither-blessed, requires protection to handle
  - The platform has a trap-door mechanism
  - Multiple watchers above, not just the visible guards
  - Need alternative approach (evidence, stay of execution, swap)
- **DC 12 Instinct** to notice the archers on ledges above
- **DC 14 Instinct** to recognize the rope is Wither-blessed and dangerous

**3. The Crowd Reactions**
- Various NPCs in the crowd have different reactions
- **Refugee Woman:** "They say he sold secrets to Haven. Deserves what he gets." (Angry, bitter)
- **Worker:** "Another execution. When will this end?" (Tired, fearful)
- **Elderly Man:** "The halfling with the lute? I heard him play once. Seemed kind." (Sad, conflicted)
- **Young Rebel:** "Traitors get what they deserve. The Masked Commander knows best." (Fervent, loyal)
- **Information:** Party can gather rumors, learn about Theodore's reputation, understand public opinion

**4. The Hidden Shrine (If Investigated)**
- **DC 14 Instinct or Hedge Rite** to discover
- **Location:** Hidden beneath the platform, in a small alcove accessible from the side
- **Description:** "Beneath the platform, in a shadowy alcove hidden from view, you find a tiny shrine. It's simple—a few candles (unlit, but ready), some dried flowers, a small carving of thorns. But it feels... peaceful. Qui'Gar's presence is here, gentle and accepting. A small piece of parchment is tucked beneath the flowers."
- **Message:** "The song ends where the thorn began. Find the second voice."
- **Purpose:** Leads to Scene 3 (The Second Voice), hints at Elder Corin's involvement
- **If Fern Present:** She may sense Qui'Gar's presence more strongly (advantage on check)

**5. Reading the Execution Notice**
- Posted prominently on several trees
- **Description:** "The notice is more detailed than the posters. It lists the charges: 'Theodore Underbrush, halfling troubadour, stands accused of treason against Fanewick, collaboration with Haven forces, and betrayal of the wild.' It's signed: 'By order of the Masked Commander and the Elder Council.' Two signatures. Two voices."

- **"The hidden shrine beneath the platform feels like a secret, a message left for those who know to look. 'Find the second voice.'"**
- **"Workers test the trap-door—it snaps open with a sharp crack. The sound echoes in the Hollow, a promise of what's to come."**

## Part 3: The Twisted Vine Tree (Group B's Destination)

**Location:** Tree 6 - The Thorn Anchor (Shadowreach, 0-100ft) - The Twisted Vine Tree

> [!NOTE] DM Note
> After witnessing the Hanging Hollow preparations, Group B heads toward the twisted vine tree where prisoners are kept. This is their destination, but they've now seen the urgency of the situation.

#### Sensory Description

**Sight:**
- A massive, corrupted structure that dominates this section of Alula's lower canopy—easily 80 feet tall and 30 feet in diameter at the base
- Once a guardian treant, now twisted and warped by the Thorngrowth Incident
- The trunk is covered in thorns—some as long as a person's forearm, others small and needle-like
- Wither-vines wrap around the trunk like constricting serpents, pulsing with dark energy in a slow, rhythmic pattern
- The structure pulses faintly with Witherwild corruption—visible as a dark aura that seems to breathe
- Platforms have been built into the tree at various levels, connected by rope ladders and narrow walkways
- Cells are visible—small openings in the trunk, barred with Wither-vines that writhe and pulse
- Four Thorn Guards patrol the base, their thorn-wreathed armor blending with the tree's corruption
- Two more guards stand on platforms above, crossbows ready
- The ground around the tree is barren—no grass, no plants, just dark, corrupted earth
- Small bones and remnants of past "feedings" are scattered around the base
- The tree's branches reach out like grasping claws, some ending in sharp thorns
- Bioluminescent fungi grow in patches, but their light is sickly and green, not the healthy glow of normal fungi

**Sound:**
- The creak of the tree itself—a low, groaning sound as if it's in constant pain
- The rustle of Wither-vines as they move and writhe
- Guards' boots on the wooden platforms, their armor clinking
- Soft weeping from within the cells—muffled, desperate
- The hum of a familiar tune from one cell—Theodore's song, hummed softly
- The snap of thorns as guards prune back overgrowth
- Distant city sounds muffled by the tree's oppressive presence
- The whisper of wind through corrupted branches—a sound like dying breaths

**Smell:**
- The heavy, oppressive scent of decay and corruption
- The metallic tang of fear and despair
- The acrid smell of Witherwild corruption—like rotting plants and spoiled earth
- Old blood and death—faint but present
- The sickly-sweet odor of the bioluminescent fungi
- The smell of unwashed prisoners and desperation

**Touch:**
- The air feels heavy and oppressive, like a physical weight
- The ground is cold and lifeless underfoot
- The tree's bark is rough and sharp—touching it risks being pricked by thorns
- A sense of being watched—the tree itself seems aware
- The Wither-vines feel warm and pulsing if touched (dangerous)
- The corruption seems to leech warmth from the air

**Taste:**
- The bitter taste of corruption and decay
- Metallic fear on the tongue
- The acrid taste of Witherwild energy

**Atmosphere:** Foreboding and dangerous. This is a place of suffering, where the city's fear and anger have been made manifest. The tree itself seems to watch, its branches like grasping claws. Every detail speaks of pain, of corruption, of the price of the city's "justice."

#### Key Details
- **Structure:** The tree has been hollowed out in places, with platforms and cells built into its trunk
- **Security:** 
  - 4 Thorn Guards patrol the base
  - 2 more guards on platforms above with crossbows
  - Additional guards may be inside the tree
- **Prisoners:** Theodore and potentially 2-3 other "traitors" are held here
- **Access:** Main entrance is guarded, but there may be hidden paths (Mara's knowledge, or investigation)
- **The Tree Itself:** Alive and aware, feeds on executed prisoners (as Fianna learned in Session 9)

#### Encounters & Events

**1. The Approach**
- The party must decide how to approach the tree
- **Description:** "The twisted vine tree looms ahead, a massive, corrupted structure that seems to pulse with dark energy. The ground around it is barren, and you can see guards patrolling the base. Above, more guards stand watch on platforms. The tree itself seems to watch you, its branches like grasping claws."
- **Options:**
  - **Direct Approach:** Walk up to guards, claim to be visitors or have business
  - **Stealth Approach:** Use Agility to sneak around, find alternate entrance (DC 14)
  - **Social Approach:** Use Presence to convince guards they have legitimate reason to be here (DC 13)
  - **Investigation:** Search for hidden paths, alternate entrances, or weaknesses (DC 14 Instinct)

**2. The Guard Encounter**
- **Thorn Guards (4 at base, 2 above):** Fanewraith-aligned soldiers wearing thorn-wreathed armor
- **Behavior:** Suspicious, aggressive, but not immediately hostile unless provoked
- **Dialogue Options:**
  - "What business do you have here?"
  - "No visitors allowed without authorization from the Masked Commander."
  - "The traitor-thorn will hang at dawn. Justice will be served."
  - "Only authorized personnel can visit prisoners."
- **Information They Might Reveal:**
  - "The execution is tomorrow at dawn, at the Hanging Hollow."
  - "Only authorized personnel can visit prisoners."
  - "The Masked Commander herself questioned the halfling earlier."
  - "The prison is secure. No one gets in or out without authorization."

**3. The Hidden Path (If Investigated)**
- **DC 14 Instinct or Agility** to find a hidden route
- **Description:** "Behind a curtain of hanging vines, you find a narrow gap in the tree's bark—a natural fissure that leads upward. It's tight, but passable. The thorns here are less dense, as if something has been cutting them back regularly. This looks like it might have been used before."
- **Result:** Leads to a hidden entrance on the second level, bypassing main guards
- **Risk:** May encounter guards inside, or trigger alarms
- **If Mara Present:** She may know of this path (advantage on check, or automatic success)

**4. The Prison Interior (If Accessed)**
- **Description:** "Inside, the tree is hollowed out into cells. Wither-vines wrap around bars, pulsing with dark energy. The air is thick with the smell of decay and fear. You can hear soft weeping from one cell, and from another, the sound of someone humming a familiar tune—Theodore's song. The cells are small, cramped, and the Wither-vines seem to tighten and relax in a slow, rhythmic pattern—like a heartbeat."
- **Cells:**
  - **Cell 1:** Empty, recently vacated—bloodstains on the floor
  - **Cell 2:** A halfling-sized figure huddled in corner (not Theodore)—weeping softly
  - **Cell 3:** Theodore Underbrush, bound but conscious—humming his song
  - **Cell 4:** A human man, silent and broken—staring at nothing
- **Fear Die Trigger:** DC 13 - "The reality of the prison hits you. These are people, waiting to die. The corruption, the despair, the hopelessness. Roll Fear die."

**5. Gnirth's Network Connection**
- **If Gnirth Present:** He may sense the tree's corruption through the Fungril network
- **Description:** "The tree's corruption reaches out through the network, a dark, hungry presence. It's aware. It's waiting. It knows you're here."
- **Fear Die Trigger:** DC 12 - "The tree's awareness washes over you through the network. It's not just a prison—it's a predator, waiting to feed. Roll Fear die."

- **Use:** Proof of identity, emotional connection for Fianna

**Wither-Vine Samples:**
- **Location:** Can be collected from the tree (dangerous)

**Guard Patrol Schedule:**
- **Location:** Posted on a board near entrance
- **Description:** "A schedule showing guard rotations, shift changes, and patrol routes. This could be useful."
- **Use:** Information about guard patterns, potential timing for infiltration

#### Daggerheart Mechanics

**Fear Die Triggers:**
- **Seeing the tree's corruption:** DC 12 Fear die - "The tree's corruption is palpable, a physical presence that seems to press down on you. This is a place of suffering, of death, of the city's darkest justice. Roll Fear die."
- **Entering the prison:** DC 13 Fear die - "The reality of the prison hits you. These are people, waiting to die. The corruption, the despair, the hopelessness. Roll Fear die."
- **Gnirth's network connection:** DC 12 Fear die - "The tree's awareness washes over you through the network. It's not just a prison—it's a predator, waiting to feed. Roll Fear die."

**Skill Checks:**
- **DC 14 Instinct or Agility:** Find hidden path
- **DC 13 Presence:** Convince guards to allow visit
- **DC 14 Agility:** Sneak past guards

    - **Call for Reinforcements:** If combat breaks out, they will call for help (additional guards arrive in 2 rounds)

**Combat Warning:** Direct combat here is extremely dangerous—guards will call reinforcements, the tree itself may react, and prisoners could be harmed.

#### Talking Points & Hooks

- **"You hear a familiar tune—Theodore's song, hummed softly. He's alive, but how long will that last?"**
- **"The guards speak of 'the Masked Commander' with reverence and fear. Whoever she is, she has their absolute loyalty."**
- **"The ground around the tree is barren, and you notice small bones scattered around the base. The tree feeds on those who are executed."**
- **"The Wither-vines pulse with dark energy, and you realize they're not just bars—they're alive, and they're hungry."**

#### Exit Hooks

- **To Prison Visit:** "If you can get past the guards, you might be able to visit Theodore. But you'll need authorization, or a very good reason."
- **To Investigation:** "The guards mentioned the Masked Commander questioned Theodore. What did she ask? What does she know?"
- **To Hanging Hollow:** "The execution is tomorrow at dawn. You've seen the preparations. Time is running out."

## Part 4: The Sun-Lofts

**Location:** Upper Canopy (Sun-Lofts) - Various locations

### Scene 2: The Mask in the Mirror (ALTERNATIVE - Unlikely to Trigger)

> [!NOTE] DM Note
> This scene is unlikely to trigger given Sabriel's disguise and reluctance to go to Sun-Lofts alone. However, it can be seeded through rumors or alternative triggers if the party investigates "recovered Stone Serpent gear."

#### Alternative Triggers
- **Rumor in Tavern:** "Heard they found some Stone Serpent armor in the upper levels. Supposed to be inspecting it."
- **Notice Board:** "Seeking expertise on recovered military equipment. Contact Sun-Lofts armory."
- **If Sabriel is Identified:** Someone recognizes him despite disguise, reports to authorities

#### Scene Description (If Triggered)
The Sun-Lofts armory is a well-organized space filled with weapons, armor, and military equipment. Stone Serpent gear is displayed on mannequins, cleaned and polished. The air smells of oil and metal. A tall figure stands in the center, examining a piece of armor. She wears a battered captain's cloak and a half-face mask of burn-scarred steel.

**Atmosphere:** Tense and personal. This is a confrontation between past and present, between what was and what has become.

#### Key Details
- **The Figure:** Evelyn DeVoss (The Masked Commander), disguised but recognizable to Sabriel
- **The Gear:** Genuine Stone Serpent equipment, recovered from various sources
- **The Trap:** Magical lock on the door, activates after 2 rounds of conversation
- **The Banner:** Coded Stone Serpent banner hidden in a chest (evidence for Scene 4)

#### Encounters & Events

**1. The Recognition**
- **DC 15 Instinct (Insight)** while she speaks reveals:
  - Micro-tics of old drill-form
  - Scar on throat shaped like serpent-scale
  - Way she adjusts strap "exactly as Captain Evelyn DeVoss did"
- **If Sabriel calls her "Captain":** She freezes—proof enough
- **Her Response:** "Then you are part of the rot we burn." Draws blade identical to Sabriel's lost-issue sword

**2. The Trap**
- Door locks magically after 2 rounds
- **Escape:** Strength or Arcana DC 16 to break the seal
- **Her Escape:** She triggers lock-spell and escapes through hidden passage
- **Sabriel:** Trapped unless he can break the seal

**3. The Banner**
- **Location:** Hidden in a chest, beneath false bottom
- **Description:** "A Stone Serpent banner, but the design is... wrong. The serpent's eyes are replaced with thorns, and the colors are inverted. This is rebel work, a perversion of the order's symbol."
- **Use:** Evidence of "treason within Haven ranks" for Scene 4

#### NPCs Present
- **Evelyn DeVoss (The Masked Commander):** In disguise, testing Sabriel
- **Armory Keeper (Optional):** May be present, can be questioned

#### Items of Interest
- **Stone Serpent Gear:** Various pieces, can be examined

- **Evelyn's Sword:** Identical to Sabriel's, proof of connection

#### Talking Points & Hooks
- **"She moves with the precision of a Stone Serpent officer, but something is... wrong. Twisted."**
- **"The banner is a mockery, a perversion of everything the order stood for."**
- **"If she recognizes you, she doesn't show it. But the way she holds that sword... you know that grip."**

### Scene 3: The Second Voice

**Location:** Elder Corin's Study (Sun-Lofts, Tree 1A - The Skyward Archive)

#### Scene Description
Elder Corin's study is part of the Skyward Archive, a vast library built into the upper canopy. The study itself is cozy but organized, filled with books, scrolls, and documents. A large desk dominates the center, and shelves line the walls. A Floating Eye hovers near the ceiling, its pupil constantly scanning. The air smells of old paper and ink.

**Atmosphere:** Scholarly and secretive. This is a place of knowledge, but also of hidden truths. The Floating Eye makes it clear that privacy is an illusion here.

#### Key Details
- **The Parchment:** Execution order, signed by both the Masked Commander and Elder Corin
- **The Duplicate:** Blank sheet with only the Masked Commander's seal (if party steals/swaps, Corin must publicly re-sign)
- **Security:**
  - **Floating Eye:** Broadcasts to Fanewraith's network, alerts on violent entry
  - **Thorn-Ward:** Screams if breached, alerts guards
  - **Corin's Schedule:** Never leaves for more than 20 minutes (real-world timer)
- **The Study:** Contains various documents, some relevant, some not

#### Encounters & Events

**1. The Rumor**
- Party may hear: "The execution order needs two signatures: the Masked Commander and a Council voice."
- **Source:** Tavern gossip, sympathetic NPC, or investigation
- **Purpose:** Leads party to investigate who the "second voice" is

- **Challenges:**
  - Avoid Floating Eye detection
  - Disable or bypass Thorn-Ward
  - Find the correct document among many

**4. The Discovery**
- **The Parchment:** "The execution order is clear: 'Theodore Underbrush, halfling, accused of treason against Fanewick and collaboration with Haven forces, to be executed at dawn.' Two signatures: one in a flowing script you don't recognize (the Masked Commander), and one in scholarly handwriting (Elder Corin)."
- **The Duplicate:** "A blank sheet, identical in size and quality, bearing only the Masked Commander's seal. Why would Corin keep this?"
- **The Forgery Opportunity:** **DC 17 Finesse (Forgery)** to add clause: "Pending confirmation of sabotage evidence"

**5. The Escape**
- If detected, Corin rushes back with 2 Thorn Guards

- **Escape:** Agility DC 14 to flee, or combat with guards

- **"Corin's signature is scholarly, precise. But why would a council member sign an execution order for someone accused of 'collaboration with Haven'?"**
- **"The duplicate blank sheet suggests Corin was prepared for something. But what?"

## Part 4: The Thorn-Ward Prison

**Location:** Lower-platform prison (near twisted vine tree)

### Scene 5: Visiting Theodore

#### Scene Description
The prison is a living cage of Wither-vines that wrap around metal bars, pulsing with dark energy. The cells are small, cramped, and the air is thick with the smell of decay and fear. Wither-vines tighten if you speak above a whisper, and guards wear thorn-rings that pulse red if they detect lies.

**Atmosphere:** Oppressive and dangerous. This is a place designed to break spirits, to make prisoners feel helpless. Every word, every movement, is monitored.

#### Key Details

- **The Vines:** Record voices, crush Theodore's ribs if visitor shouts, lies, or casts magic
- **The Guards:** Wear thorn-rings that detect lies (pulse red)

#### Encounters & Events

  - **Bribe:** Pay guards (costs coin, may raise suspicion)
  - **Stealth:** Sneak in during shift change or distraction
  - **Authority:** Claim to have authorization (risky, may be checked)

**2. The Visit**
- Only one visitor allowed at a time
- **Theodore's Condition:** "Alive but broken. His clothes are torn, his face bruised. But his eyes still hold a spark of defiance, and when he sees you, they light up with recognition and hope."
- **The Conversation:** Must be whispered, must be truthful (thorn-rings detect lies)
- **Theodore's Information:**
  - "Brindle is dead. I had to... I had to end her suffering. The corruption was too far gone."
  - "Sky is alive. The fawn—she's hidden in the root-cellar beneath the kitchens. You must find her."
  - "They're going to hang me at dawn. But it's not about me—it's about sending a message. About showing that 'traitors' won't be tolerated."
  - "The Masked Commander... she questioned me. Asked about Nikta, about the Eye, about Haven. She knows things she shouldn't."

**3. The Token**
- Theodore presses a broken antler-tip into visitor's palm
- **Description:** "A small piece of antler, broken and rough. It's Brindle's—you recognize it from the ambush site. Theodore's eyes are wet as he gives it to you."
- **Purpose:** Proof to Fianna that Theodore's story is true, that Sky is alive

**4. The Bloom-Seed (If Prepared)**
- **DC 14 Finesse** to slip Theodore the seed without detection
- **Description:** "A single Lady's Veil petal, soaked in sedative. It's small, easily hidden. If Theodore takes it, it will slow his heart enough to make him appear dead at the hanging—buying time for a body-swap."
- **Requirements:** Must be prepared beforehand (acquired from herbalist, or Fern's hedge magic)
- **Risk:** If detected, vines crush Theodore immediately

**5. Evelyn's Departure**
- After 15 minutes, Evelyn leaves
- **Description:** "The Masked Commander finishes her questioning and rises. She's tall, imposing, her mask hiding her face. But her movements are precise, military. She moves like a Stone Serpent officer. She glances at you as she leaves, and for a moment, you feel seen—truly seen."
- **If Sabriel Present:** May recognize her movements, her bearing (DC 12 Instinct)

#### NPCs Present
- **Theodore Underbrush:** In Cell 3, weakened but alive
- **Evelyn DeVoss (The Masked Commander):** Questioning Theodore, leaves after 15 minutes

- **The Bloom-Seed:** If prepared, can be given to Theodore
- **Theodore's Broken Lute:** Visible in cell, reminder of the ambush

#### Talking Points & Hooks

- **"The thorn-rings on the guards' fingers pulse faintly, ready to detect any lie."**
- **"Theodore's eyes hold both hope and resignation. He knows his time is short, but he's trying to help you anyway."**

- **Time Delays:** Group A (tunnels) takes 15-20 minutes, Group B can have scenes during this time
- **Reconnection:** Allow groups to reconnect through network (if working) or physical meeting

### Communication
- **Fungril Network:** May be blocked or intermittent (creates tension)
- **Physical Meeting:** Groups can meet at designated location (twisted vine tree, tavern, etc.)
- **Messages:** Groups can leave messages, use NPCs to communicate

### Dramatic Timing
- **Reveals:** Use split to create dramatic reveals (one group learns something, other doesn't)
- **Parallel Tension:** Both groups face challenges simultaneously
- **Convergence:** Bring groups together at key moments (prison, council, execution)

### Example Flow
1. **Group A (Tunnels):** 15-20 minutes of travel, encounters, blocked communication
2. **Group B (Thorn Tree):** During same time, approaches tree, deals with guards, investigates
3. **Reconnection:** Groups meet at tree or designated location
4. **Combined Action:** Party works together for prison visit, council, or execution

## DM Notes & Reminders

### Key Principles
- **Fail-Forward:** Every failure advances the story, even if Theodore dies
- **Player Agency:** Let party choose their path, don't force specific scenes
- **Time Pressure:** Use real-world timers to create urgency
- **Emotional Stakes:** Focus on personal connections (Fianna-Theodore, Sabriel-Evelyn)

### Pacing
- **Opening:** Fast-paced, establish urgency
- **Middle:** Investigation and planning, allow party to explore
- **Climax:** Execution scene, high tension, final choices
- **Resolution:** Aftermath, consequences, setup for next session

### Adaptability
- **Be Flexible:** Party may skip scenes, combine approaches, or find creative solutions
- **Improvise:** If party goes off-script, use NPCs and locations to guide them back
- **Say Yes:** If party has creative idea, find way to make it work (with appropriate challenges)

### Emotional Beats
- **Hope:** Theodore is alive, there's still time
- **Despair:** Time is running out, security is tight
- **Revelation:** Discoveries about Evelyn, Corin, the truth
- **Tension:** Final moments, impossible choices
- **Resolution:** Whatever happens, the story continues

## Conclusion

This session is about impossible choices, hidden truths, and the weight of time. Whether Theodore lives or dies, the party will carry the consequences forward. The revelation of Evelyn's identity, the discovery of Corin's betrayal, the knowledge of Sky's location—all of these will shape the sessions to come.

Remember: the goal is not to save Theodore at all costs, but to create a meaningful story where the party's choices matter. If they succeed, celebrate their victory. If they fail, honor their loss and use it to drive the narrative forward.

**The dawn will come. The choice is theirs.**
