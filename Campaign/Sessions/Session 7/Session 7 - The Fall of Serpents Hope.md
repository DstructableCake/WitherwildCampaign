# Daggerheart – Session 7 Notes

**Title:** _The Siege of Serpents Hope - Part 2_  
**Theme:** Desperate defense, escalating corruption, and the bitter price of choices—dawn reveals the cost of impossible decisions.  
**Setting:** The siege at Serpents Hope Farms continues at daybreak, the battle raging across warehouses, civilian quarters, and the awakening fields as corruption births a guardian of twisted roots and bone.

---

## The Battle Continues

The session opened with the siege already underway, chaos spreading across the farm like wildfire. The three Flameburst Fireflies lay dead, their explosive ends leaving scorch marks across the ground and the acrid smell of charred chitin hanging in the air. Only the Briarback Boar remained, its hide bristling with thorns as it charged through the smouldering wreckage of the civilian quarters.

Sabriel took command of the strategy, his voice cutting through the chaos with practiced authority. With the warehouses under attack and the Wither Touched Stag already having breached three walls, he made the call: Snicket would provide support to Fern and Fianna against the Bloodwings and the stag before any further damage could be done to the warehouses and the Lady's Veil flowers. Gnirth would tackle the boar alone—a calculated risk, but one that allowed the party to address multiple threats simultaneously. He himself would broach the mist, and hold off whatever threats would be concealed within.

To reduce the distance as fast as possible, they sprinted across the farm, boots pounding against the earth, breath coming in sharp gasps. The exertion left them winded for a moment, but there was no time to rest. However, as they ran, Sabriel broke off from the group, veering toward the fog dust cloud that loomed over the eastern fields. Whatever was hidden in that mist, he would hold it off while the others secured the warehouses.

## Gnirth's Desperate Fight

Gnirth found himself alone against the Briarback Boar, and the creature was not going down easily. He attempted to sear the beast with his blazing hands, maneuvering through its thorny hide to reach the flesh beneath. Heat radiated from his palms as he began to cook the creature's hide, the smell of burning hair and charred meat filling the air.

But the boar was cunning. It bolted through a fence, and in doing so, its thorns snagged Gnirth's clothing, pinning him against the creature's side. The barbs dug deep, tearing fabric and skin as the boar charged forward, dragging Gnirth through mud and dirt like a ragdoll.

The world became a blur of motion and pain. The boar crashed through a building, the impact setting the structure ablaze. Flames licked at the walls, and the building groaned under the assault. Still attached, still being dragged, Gnirth felt the heat of the fire as they burst through to the other side, heading toward another building in the row.

It was then that a scream pierced the air—high, terrified, the sound of someone who knew they were about to die. In the corner of the collapsing building, hunched and trying to stay away from the flames, Gnirth spotted a lone figure: a teenager, trapped and terrified, the fire closing in around them.

Time seemed to slow. The building was coming down. The boar was still charging. The flames were spreading. But in that moment, something shifted in Gnirth—a clarity that cut through the chaos. He released one of his hands from the boar's barbs, ignoring the pain as thorns tore free, and reached past the flames toward the surrounding bog.

The water answered his call. It ripped through the air like a living thing, a torrent of moisture that hit the young man with enough force to both coat his body in a protective layer and knock a hole in the wall behind him. The teenager scrambled through the opening, escaping just as the building's supports gave way.

Still attached to the boar, now ablaze and suffering from the fire, Gnirth felt the creature charge toward the next building in the row. But before it could reach it, the boar buckled, its legs giving out. It fell in a slump, one final squeal of agony escaping its throat before it fell silent, the flames consuming what remained.

## Into the Mist

Meanwhile, across the fields, the looming fog cloud drew ever closer, obscuring the rows of white flowers in fine dust and dirt. The light of the sun cast rainbow refractions where it filtered through the particles, creating an otherworldly beauty that belied the danger within.

Sabriel reached the edge of the smoke wall, and the ground around him was sodden and wet, soaked in a black ooze that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. Taking a deep breath, he passed through the veil.

Initially, there was a coldness as the mist breached his skin, seeping into his armor and chilling him to the bone. Sounds of combat dampened around him—the screaming, crying, and explosions fading to nothing more than white noise, as if he had stepped into another world entirely. As he marched deeper into the abyss, quietly chanting prayers that steeled his heart, shadows and visages of battle materialized around him. The earth was broken, churned and torn. Briefly, a body appeared before vanishing into the mist once more—a ghost of the conflict, or something worse.

Through the fog, motions in the wind showed where the Glasswing Moths hovered, their iridescent wings catching what little light penetrated the mist. Sabriel launched a preemptive attack, his sword scratching down the body of one of the glassy moths, but the damage was minimal—the creature's exoskeleton was tougher than it appeared. Channeling his faith, the sword glowed with inner light, acting as a beacon to all those around, still steadied by his prayer and quiet chanting.

## The Warehouse Defense

Moving on toward the warehouses, the guards had acted in haste. While the creatures were distracted by the battle, over half of the flower stock had been moved—a small victory in the face of overwhelming odds, but one that mattered.

Fianna was on the attack, summoning tiny fireflies that swarmed around the Bloodwings and Stag, their bioluminescent bodies warding off and damaging the surrounding foes. They were starting to chip away at the forces, taking down two of the flying demons in bursts of ichor and chitin.

Snicket arrived like a shadow given form, her shadow bind wrapping around the stag and holding it back from attacking anymore, saving the warehouse for the time being. One of the Bloodwings swooped down to attack Fianna, but the strike went wide, the creature's proboscis missing by inches. Fern took aim and launched a lightning bolt at the Bloodwing that was hovering just above, the crack of thunder followed by an explosion that sent the creature's remains raining down, covering Fianna with bile and guts.

The fog was making its way slowly toward the warehouse at this point, and with the stag bound, Fern placed one hand on its midriff. The creature stopped thrashing, as if coming to peace with what was about to happen. There was a moment of stillness, a breath held, and then Fern delivered a jolt to the heart that stopped it in a blink of an eye. The stag's body went limp, the corruption receding in death.

---

## The Vision and the Awakening

While this was happening, Gnirth—regaining his composure after the boar's death—headed directly toward the fog wall to assist Sabriel. At this point, the farmland was sunk down a few inches in black ooze, the substance wrapping itself around Gnirth's ankles like a living thing, pulling at him with an almost sentient hunger.

He took a step into the wall of rainbow mist, and immediately, his connection to Fern was cut off. The Fungril network went silent, replaced by something else entirely.

The visions came to him.

>[!Quote] Vision
>The ooze feels warm, almost alive, against your skin. For a moment, you're back in Tideveil Enclave. You stand in a circle of your clan, chanting words you can't remember but feel in your bones. The air shimmers with water magic, and before you—a massive water elemental, bound and thrashing. Someone hands you a pouch of dark dust. "For renewal," they whisper. "To cleanse the stagnation." You pour it into the ritual circle, and the elemental screams.

The memory hit like a physical blow, and Gnirth staggered, the truth of what he had done—what he had been—washing over him in waves of horror and recognition.

Ahead of him, the faint light of Sabriel's sword could be seen through the mist, a beacon in the darkness. The Glasswing Moths were making their way toward him also, their forms shimmering like broken glass in the fog. The wall of mist had reached the warehouse, and at that moment, a blood-curdling roar ripped into the air, piercing the mist like a blade.

The sound was unlike anything they had heard—primal, ancient, filled with rage and corruption. Glasswing Moths shattered where they floated, falling to the ground like snow, their crystalline bodies breaking apart at the sound. The mist began to fade, leaving a low-hanging fog around the fields that spread across the farmland like a shroud.

In the middle of the field, it stood.

## The Warden Emerges

A towering, antlered spirit of corrupted woods, standing over twelve feet tall, its body woven from twisted roots, bone, and living wood that pulsed with a malevolent heartbeat. The creature's antlers were massive and branch-like, extending far above its head and creating a crown of natural weapons that dripped with corrosive sap. Its body was a complex network of interwoven roots and bone, with glowing green eyes that burned with ancient wisdom and malevolence. The leshen's hands ended in sharp, claw-like fingers made of bone and wood, dripping with corrupted essence. Its form seemed to shift and change as it moved, with roots and branches constantly rearranging themselves. The creature was surrounded by an aura of ancient power and corruption, and spectral ravens circled around its antlers, their eyes glowing with the same malevolent light.

Surrounding the creature was a brood of Brambleweb Crawlers—a cluster of large, spider-like insects that had been corrupted by fungal spores. Their bodies were the size of small dogs, exoskeletons mottled brown-black with patches of sickly green fungal growth. Their legs were covered in sharp bramble thorns that glistened with dark, viscous liquid. Their multiple eyes glowed with malevolent red light, and their mandibles dripped with a corrosive substance that ate through metal equipment. They moved with unsettling speed and coordination, their thorn-covered legs clicking against wooden structures. Behind them, they left trails of sticky, web-like material that glowed faintly and seemed to decay whatever it touched.

The party rallied around Sabriel and Gnirth at this point, their weapons ready, their resolve steeled. This was the true threat—the guardian of corruption, born from the fields they had been forced to abandon.

## The Desperate Battle

The spiders took aim at Fianna and Fern, but their attacks went wide, the party's agility proving superior to the crawlers' coordination. The Leshen, however, was another matter entirely. Using its Venom Thorn Surge, it reached out and swiped down at Sabriel, the thorns piercing through his armor and inflicting core damage. Sabriel managed to avoid the poison, but the impact was devastating—his chest piece cracked, the metal groaning under the assault.

Right away, Fianna transformed into a snake, her form coiling with deadly grace. She tag-teamed with Snicket to inflict poison on everything in range. They managed to score direct hits on all foes—the spiders taking significant damage, but the Leshen looking as if it enjoyed the venom, the corruption within it feeding on the attack.

Gnirth responded to the attacks with an attempt to manipulate the water around him. The only liquid available was the black ooze that was soaking the farms, but he managed to wield it as if it were water itself. The ooze answered his call, and he scored a direct and critical hit, ripping right through the Leshen and blasting a hole through its torso. The impact was devastating—the creature was knocked back, and vines reached up from the ground to try to stabilize it as it fell back fifteen feet, the earth itself trying to protect its guardian.

Sabriel took the opportunity to use his last roll of his Unstoppable ability, pouncing on the Leshen and attempting to pin the creature down. His weight and strength combined with the momentum of his charge, driving the creature deeper into the tainted soil.

Fern tag-teamed with Sabriel, channeling her lightning down through the Leshen and into the area around it using his whirlwind ability. The electricity arced through the creature's wooden body and into the ground, creating a web of lightning that succeeded in thinning the horde of spiders. Several of the crawlers convulsed and fell, their bodies smoking from the electrical discharge.

But the spiders were relentless. They kept up their attacks on the party, sinking their fangs into Fianna and damaging her for half her health points. The venom burned, and she cried out in pain—they could really pack a punch if not dealt with quickly.

The damage dealt to the Leshen was considerable with such a surge of attacks. In response, it attempted to rally and call upon spectral ravens to try to keep the party distracted, but only one returned its call—the corruption had weakened its connection to the natural world, even as it twisted it.

The raven attempted to attack Fianna, succeeding in hitting and causing her to be vulnerable for one turn. But before it could capitalize on the advantage, Fianna's ability caused the raven to explode in flame, coating her in more guts with her fire element. She took a small breather to down a health potion and recover a little, the liquid cool against her burning wounds.

At this point, the party were all very close together, and the spiders took advantage. They webbed up the areas all around them, creating a trap of sticky, decaying material. Two of the party members were constrained, the webs digging into their skin and taking more damage as they struggled.

In response, Gnirth gathered his fire and channeled it through Sabriel once more, the flames tearing through the Leshen and searing the ground around the party. The heat was intense, but it served its purpose—the webbing burned away, freeing the two constrained party members just in time.

Snicket followed up with shadow blades that took out the final spiders around the fields in one fell swoop. Each body that dropped caused a roar from the Leshen, as if it itself took the hit. The connection between the guardian and its minions was deeper than they had realized. It was now just the large wooden monstrosity versus the party.

---

## The Final Stand

At the loss of the spiders, and near death, the Leshen unleashed ferocious attacks against the party. It utilized its Venom Thorn Surge, aimed squarely at Sabriel's chest piece, piercing through the already damaged armor and dealing severe poison damage. The venom coursed through his veins, burning like acid, and Sabriel felt his strength begin to fail.

At the same time, the Leshen reached deep into the soil and called on the roots to bind the party. All party members, save for Fern, were latched onto—roots wrapping and digging deep into their appendages, slowly dragging them down into the earth. The ground itself had turned against them, the corruption so deep that even the soil was an enemy.

Fern was chanting away, her voice rising above the chaos. Her target—the Leshen—was square in her sights for her Hex. Drowning out the pain of her party, taking a deep breath, she spoke her binding into existence. Wrapping around the Leshen in a silent shadow, it revealed areas where it was weak, the best places to strike.

And strike she did.

One last lightning bolt. Aimed directly at the Leshen's heart—or whatever passed for a heart in that twisted form. A crack of thunder that split the air. An intake of breath from the creature. And it fell, for good.

The battlefield fell silent for the briefest of moments, the only sound the crackling of the Leshen's body as it began to crumble, the corruption receding from its form like a tide pulling back from the shore.

The skirmishes at the forest's edge dissipated not long after, the creatures in retreat. The coordinated assault had failed, but at what cost?

## Aftermath and Reflection

In the aftermath, Sabriel began to retrieve bodies found in the field, taking them back to the field tent. Too many bodies that shouldn't be there—farm workers, guards, civilians caught in the crossfire. Each one was a failure, a life that could have been saved. Spotting Quartermaster Brill tending to his own wounds, there was a nod of acknowledgement and respect between the two soldiers. Sabriel continued in prayer for both himself and those that were felled, seeking to cleanse the corruption of the faint divinities from his body, to find some measure of peace in the face of so much death.

Fianna and Fern took the time to clean themselves up from the various bodily fluids now coating them, but they also collected samples—two intact beaks from the Bloodwings, three sacks of blood, and small shards of the Glasswing Moths scattered around the fields. These might prove useful, might hold answers to the corruption that was spreading.

It took several days for the backups to arrive and help support the cleanup of the farms. The land was now tainted, the black ooze having seeped deep into the soil. It was not likely possible to sow more seeds for several months, if ever. The fields that had once bloomed with white flowers would lie fallow, a scar on the landscape that would serve as a reminder of the price of impossible choices.

Bodies were in the process of being returned to Haven for proper rites. Thanks to the actions of the party, the immediate supply of red Lady's Veil flowers were recovered and on their way back to Haven for processing, so there was no shortage of immediate supplies. On top of that, countless lives were saved in the barracks and civilian areas—families who would live to breathe another day, children who would see another sunrise.

The party took the time to recover, to ask around for information and details, to gather potential supplies for the road ahead. The session ended there, with the weight of victory and loss settling over them like a heavy cloak. They had won, but the cost was written in the tainted fields and the bodies being carried away. The road to Alula awaited, and with it, answers about Theodore, Fanewraith, and the corruption that seemed to be spreading faster with each passing day.
