# **Daggerheart – Session 7 Notes**

**Title:** _The Siege of Serpents Hope - Part 2_  
**Theme:** Desperate defense, escalating corruption, and the bitter price of choices—dawn reveals the cost of impossible decisions.  
**Setting:** The siege at Serpents Hope Farms continues at daybreak, an unusual time for such attacks. The party remains split between warehouses and civilian quarters as corruption awakens in the neglected fields, birthing a guardian of twisted roots and bone.

## **Scene 1 – The Battle Continues**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 1 – Narration  
Dawn's first light pierces the fray, but the battle rages on. The three Flameburst Fireflies lie dead, their explosive ends leaving scorch marks across the ground. Only the Briarback Boar remains, its hide bristling with thorns as it charges through the smoldering wreckage. At the warehouses, the Wither Touched Stag continues its assault—three walls already breached, the structure groaning under each impact. Bloodwings still circle overhead, their dark forms diving and weaving with predatory grace. And in the distance, the fields begin to tremble.

**Current Battle State:**

- **Quarters (Sabriel, Gnirth, Snicket):** All three Flameburst Fireflies eliminated. Only the Briarback Boar remains—finish it quickly.
- **Warehouses (Fern, Fianna):** Wither Touched Stag has destroyed 3 of 8 walls. All Bloodwings still active and evasive. Guards attempting to salvage Lady's Veil flowers.
- **Fields (Unguarded):** Glasswing Moths continue their dust cloud. Earthrend Molebeast has torn through 3 fields. Corruption building.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Smoldering firefly corpses, boar's thorns glinting, stag's antlers striking wood, fields shaking in the distance.
- **Sound:** Boar's snorts, warehouse walls splintering, bloodwing wings buzzing, distant ground rumbling.
- **Smell:** Acrid smoke, charred flesh, animal musk, something metallic and wrong from the fields.
- **Touch:** Heat from fires, trembling earth growing stronger, splintered wood underfoot.
- **Taste:** Bitter ash, metallic dread.

**The Fields Awaken – The Twist:**

As the boar fight concludes and the warehouse battle continues, the ground in the eastern fields begins to shake with increasing violence. From the holes left by the Earthrend Molebeast, black liquid begins to seep—thick, oily, almost like crude oil mixed with something organic. It bubbles and pools, spreading like veins of corruption across the tainted soil. The Glasswing Moths scatter, their dust cloud breaking as something far worse prepares to emerge.

**Gnirth's Connection:**

Gnirth feels it first—a pull, a resonance. The black ooze calls to something deep within him, something that echoes the void of his lost memories. The chaos, the corruption, the raw power of it all feels... familiar. He must make an **Instinct save (DC 13)** or be drawn toward the fields, compelled to investigate the source of this dark energy. On a failure, he feels an overwhelming urge to approach, to touch the ooze, to understand what it means. On a success, he resists but feels the pull like a physical weight—he knows something terrible is coming.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to make the **ground shake more violently**, forcing Agility saves or characters are knocked prone.
- Spend Fear to have the **ooze pulse** unnaturally, forcing an Instinct save or minor condition (e.g., Slowed from nausea).
- Spend Fear to have **ooze spread faster**, creating hazardous terrain.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **creeping rot** - the sense that the land itself rejects them.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** The boar is nearly finished—how do you finish it and then assess the greater threat?
- **Snicket:** The fields pulse with dark energy—do you spot the pattern, the purpose behind this attack?
- **Fern:** The corruption jolts your network—what imbalance do you sense in the fields?
- **Fianna:** The warehouse needs defending, but the fields call—how do you balance immediate need with greater threat?
- **Gnirth:** The ooze calls to you—do you resist the pull or answer it? What does it remind you of?

**GM Prompt:**  
Run 2-3 rounds to finish current threats, then introduce the fields twist. The ooze should feel ominous, building tension toward Scene 2.

- **Quarters (Final Round):** Finish the boar—allow a satisfying conclusion to this fight.
- **Warehouses (Ongoing):** Stag continues assault. Bloodwings remain elusive. Guards are evacuating flowers.
- **Fields (The Twist):** Ground shakes, ooze seeps from mole holes. Gnirth feels the pull (Instinct save). The party must decide: finish warehouse fight or converge for the greater threat.

**Options:**

- **Converge Early:** If party recognizes the threat, they can signal to regroup (Presence DC 12) and move toward fields.
- **Finish First:** Complete warehouse/quarters fights, then face the emerging threat together.
- **Split Further:** Some stay at warehouses, others investigate fields (risky but allows both objectives).

**GM Options / Variations:**

- If party converges quickly: Leshen emerges mid-warehouse fight, creating a three-way battle.
- If party finishes first: Leshen emerges as they regroup, full party ready for boss fight.
- Variation: Ooze spreads to warehouses, creating environmental hazard.

**Transition Line:**  
The boar falls, the warehouse groans, and from the fields—the ground erupts. Black ooze boils over as something massive begins to rise.

## Scene 2 – The Warden Awakens

>[!QUOTE] Scene 2 – Narration  
The ground erupts. Black ooze boils over like a geyser of corruption, and from the churning pools rises a nightmare made manifest. The Leshen Warden towers above the fields, its antlered form a weave of corrupted root and bone, black ooze pulsing through its wooden veins like a twisted circulatory system. Its eyes—deep hollows in the bark—glow with malevolent light. The earth cracks around it as Brambleweb Crawlers erupt from the ooze, their thorny legs skittering across the tainted soil, webs already spreading like a plague. The guardian strides forward, the air filling with wither-mist and the sound of snapping branches. 

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Towering leshen (12+ feet tall), antlers pulsing with black energy; 5-6 brambleweb crawlers emerging from ooze pools; webs spreading across fields; ooze-veins glowing in leshen's body.
- **Sound:** Warden's creaking roar like breaking timber; web cracks as crawlers move; ground rumbling; distant screams from farm workers.
- **Smell:** Rotting sap mixed with petroleum-like ooze; venomous tang from crawlers; bitter spores.
- **Touch:** Misty chill emanating from leshen; vibrating earth under ooze; sticky webs catching on clothing.
- **Taste:** Bitter spores on the wind; metallic corruption.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to amplify **Leshen roar**, forcing group Instinct save vs. Fear (failure = gain 1 Fear token).
- Spend Fear to have **webs spread faster**, creating difficult terrain.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as **rooted paralysis** - limbs heavy with creeping blight.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** The leshen targets the weak—how do you shield civilians and party members?
- **Snicket:** Webs block paths—cut through or find another route? The leshen's movements reveal patterns.
- **Fern:** Ooze taints your network—can you purge it with a rite, or must you sever the connection?
- **Fianna:** Minions snare innocents—call nature to free them, or focus on the greater threat?
- **Gnirth:** The ooze calls to you—do you channel its power against the warden, or does it threaten to consume you?

**GM Prompt:**  
Multi-phase boss fight: Phase 1—Leshen + 5 crawlers; Phase 2 (at half HP)—Leshen becomes more aggressive, may summon additional ooze hazards or use Venom Thorn Surge more frequently. Objectives: Defeat the Leshen while managing crawlers and avoiding poison. 4-6 rounds expected.

- If party excels: Add ooze-spawned hazards, or have Leshen summon spectral allies.
- **Variation A (Horror Focus):** Ooze causes visions of Gnirth's lost memories. See "Gnirth's Ooze Visions" below.
- Variation B (Action Focus): More environmental interactions—use warehouse debris, farm equipment, etc.

**Transition Line:**  
The warden crumbles, its antlers splintering as black ooze recedes into the earth. The crawlers scatter, but the fields lie tainted—a heavy price paid. Dawn fully breaks, revealing the full extent of the devastation.

## Scene 3 – Aftermath at the Farms

>[!QUOTE] Scene 3 – Narration  
Dawn fully breaks over Serpents Hope, but victory tastes of ash. The warehouses smolder—three walls destroyed, but the Lady's Veil flowers were saved, at least in part. The civilian quarters stand cracked but held, families emerging from shelters with hollow eyes and grateful tears. And the fields... the fields lie tainted, black ooze seeping into the soil like a poison that will linger for seasons. The cost of impossible choices settles like pollen on the morning air.

But something gnaws at the edges of this victory. This attack came at daybreak—unusual, unexpected. Most assaults happen under Nightveil's cover, when darkness provides protection. Someone planned this. Someone knew when defenses would be lowest, when guards would be changing shifts, when the farm would be most vulnerable. This was no random assault—it was calculated, coordinated, and it speaks to an intelligence behind the corruption that chills more deeply than any beast.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Smoking warehouse ruins, tainted black soil spreading across fields, weary survivors huddled together, guards assessing damage, white flowers trampled and stained.
- **Sound:** Muffled sobs from families, clank shutdown whirs as machines power down, distant thanks mixed with curses, Quartermaster Brill's clipped orders.
- **Smell:** Char and rot, unmet incense from ruined fields, the acrid tang of ooze still lingering.
- **Touch:** Cooling embers, sticky ooze that won't wash away, splintered wood, grateful hands clasping yours.
- **Taste:** Bitter regret, the metallic tang of corruption.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to have ooze **linger** unnaturally, tainting a memento (e.g., black-veined flower that won't heal).
- Spend Fear for **survivor whisper** of lingering curses—someone speaks of nightmares, of the land's anger.
- If PCs gain Fear, describe as **weight of consequence** - the land's grudge, the knowledge that some choices can't be undone.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** Survivors look to you—what atonement do you offer? How do you explain the cost?
- **Snicket:** Amid the chaos, you notice something—a pattern, a detail others missed. What does the timing reveal?
- **Fern:** Tainted soil pulses with imbalance—what can you attempt to restore, if anything?
- **Fianna:** Heal the wounded; hear Theodore rumors from grateful survivors. Someone mentions seeing a bard.
- **Gnirth:** The ooze echoes the void in your memories—what clues does it offer about your past?

**NPCs:**

**Quartermaster Brill (Human, Haven Commander)**  
- **Appearance:** Rumpled uniform, exhausted frown, blood-stained sleeve from treating wounded.

- **Temperament:** Grateful for lives saved but bitter over tainted fields. The corruption will spread—seasons of work lost.

- **Information:** Theodore rumor (saw him days ago, heading toward Alula); offers guide if party earns respect; knows local paths and dangers.
- **Quests/Hooks:** If party helps with cleanup or shows respect for the land, offers a guide to Alula. Warns of growing unrest among Wicklings toward Haven.

**Clank Handler Pex (Human, Haven Technician)**  
- **Appearance:** Grease-stained overalls, toolkit still clutched in shaking hands, goggles pushed up on forehead.
- **Voice:** Enthusiastic but shaken, words tumbling out.
- **Personality:** Machine-loving, naive but well-meaning.
- **Temperament:** Upset over damaged clanks but grateful party fought well. Eager to help if party shows interest.
- **Soundbites:** "My poor machines... but you fought well." / "Heard whispers of worse in Alula—corruption spreading faster there." / "The ooze... it's like nothing I've seen. Almost alive."
- **Information:** Tech insights about corruption's effect on machinery; minor repair boon (can fix one item); rumors about Alula's worsening state.

- Workers mourning lost fields, some blaming Haven
- Guards sharing rumors about coordinated attacks elsewhere
- Someone mentions seeing a hooded figure watching from the treeline before the attack

**GM Prompt:**  
RP recovery and information gathering. Tally successes and consequences:

- **Warehouses Saved:** Quartermaster Brill grateful, offers supplies. Some Lady's Veil flowers preserved.
- **Quarters Saved:** Families grateful, Steward Vel respects party. Potential guides and local knowledge.
- **Fields Lost:** Steward Vel bitter but understanding. Fields tainted for seasons. Wickling resentment toward Haven grows.
- **Unusual Timing:** Multiple NPCs note the daybreak attack was unusual—builds mystery around Fanewraith's planning.

**Key Information to Reveal:**

1. **Theodore Sighting:** Steward Vel confirms seeing a bard matching Fianna's father description, heading toward Alula days ago.
2. **Daybreak Attack:** Unusual timing suggests planning and intelligence behind the assault.
3. **Alula Warnings:** Both Pex and Brill mention corruption spreading faster in Alula—worse than here.
4. **Fanewraith's Hand:** The coordination, the timing, the Leshen—this was no random attack. Someone is orchestrating this.

**GM Options / Variations:**

- **Social Focus:** Deepen with survivor stories, allow party to help with cleanup, build relationships.
- **Horror Focus:** Ooze causes visions—Gnirth sees fragments of his past, others see glimpses of Fanewraith's plans.
- **What If?** If fields fully lost, Wicklings blame Haven more openly—potential alliance hook or conflict source.
- **Reward Variation:** Based on what was saved, adjust rewards and NPC attitudes.

**Transition Line:**  
As cleanup begins and reports are written, the road calls—Alula awaits, and with it, answers about Theodore, Fanewraith, and the corruption spreading like a plague. But first, there is the weight of what was lost, and what was saved.

## Notes for Future Sessions

- **Fields Taint Spreads:** Future sessions feature corrupted variants of creatures and environments.
- **Fanewraith's Awareness:** The party's role in defending the farms is noted—Fanewraith may target them specifically.
- **Elowen's Return:** The kind old woman may return, but potentially manipulated or changed by Fanewraith's influence.
- **Wickling Relations:** If party showed respect for the land, potential allies. If they favored Haven exclusively, growing unrest.
- **Daybreak Attack Pattern:** This unusual timing may be repeated—Fanewraith exploits when defenses are lowest.
- **Gnirth's Connection:** The ooze's pull to Gnirth suggests deeper ties to the corruption—explore this thread.
- **Alula's State:** Corruption spreading faster there—worse threats await.
