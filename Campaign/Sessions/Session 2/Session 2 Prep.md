## **Scene 1 – Departure from Stolen Fen**

> [!QUOTE] Scene 1 – Narration  
> The settlement of Stolen Fen is dimly lit, lanterns hooded and fires banked low. The air is heavy with the scent of peat smoke and damp reeds. Traders move quietly, their voices hushed, as if the night itself is listening. The Clanks in the fields stand motionless, their work paused until dawn.  
>  
> At the edge of the settlement, a wagon waits — its wheels reinforced for the marshy ground, its driver a weary man with a lantern hung low. A pair of oxen snort and stamp, uneasy in the gathering dark.  

**Captain Thorne’s Beat**

> [!QUOTE] Captain Thorne  
> “Arden. About yesterday… I should’ve been ready. I let the drink get the better of me, and I let you down. Won’t happen again. You’ve got my word.”  

- GM Prompt:  
  - Let Sabriel respond — forgiveness, sternness, or silence.  
  - Thorne offers a final warning: *“Nightveil’s no time for travel. But if you must, keep your eyes sharp. The dark has a way of hiding more than shadows.”*  

**Wagon Driver NPC**  
- **Name:** Harlon Dree  
- Human, mid-40s, weathered, missing two fingers.  
- Gruff, mutters prayers, chews on a reed.  
- Line: *“The fen’s quiet tonight. Too quiet. That’s never good.”*  

**Optional Guard NPC**  
- Nervous recruit, young and underfed.  
- More liability than help — may panic or need protecting.

### Before Departure (Stolen Fen)

- Shrine to Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End
	- A small roadside shrine near the wagon yard.
	- Locals leave offerings of thorny branches, honey, or flowers for safe passage.
	- Qui’Gar is associated with endings and protection through pain — fitting for a journey into Nightveil.

>[!QUOTE] Shrine to Qui’Gar
A small wooden shrine stands near the wagon yard, draped in thorny vines and wilted flowers. A clay bowl of honey sits at its base, buzzing faintly with insects. Locals bow their heads as they pass, whispering for safe passage through the fen.

- GM Note: This is a great RP hook for Fern or Fianna (both tied to nature/divinity). Sabriel might ignore it (Haven’s “godless” ethos), which could spark a small RP clash.

## **Scene 2 – On the Road (Nightveil Travel)**

> [!QUOTE] Scene 2 – Narration  
> The wagon creaks along the narrow track, its lantern casting a pale circle of light. Beyond it, the world is swallowed by Nightveil — the strange twilight where the stars burn brighter, and the air feels thick, as if holding its breath. The reeds whisper in the wind, and every splash of water sounds too close.

### **Encounter 1: The Watcher in the Reeds**

> [!QUOTE] Encounter – Narration  
> Out of the corner of your eye, you see movement — a cloaked figure standing among the reeds, still as a statue. Their face is hidden, but you feel their gaze. 
> And then, as the wagon creaks forward, they turn and begin to walk into the darkness.  

Senses:

- Sight: Cloak blending with reeds, faint glint of metal at their belt.
- Sound: The reeds rustle though there’s no wind. A faint splash as they step away.
- Smell: Damp earth, faint tang of oil or smoke.
- Touch: The air feels colder where they stood, like a draft.
- Taste: Metallic tang in the back of the throat, like blood or iron.

Fear Usage:

- Spend Fear to let the spy vanish more effectively (teleport further, leave no trace).
- Spend Fear to leave behind a false clue (a misleading token).
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a paranoia spike — the sense of being watched even after the figure is gone.

> [!NOTE] GM Options  
> - **Follow:** Leads to a tense chase through reeds.  
> - **Confront:** The Watcher resists briefly, then vanishes in smoke/darkness.  
> - **Ignore:** They disappear, but leave behind a token (Fanewraith’s mark).  

> [!STATBLOCK] Fanewraith Spy (Watcher)  
> - Health: 10
> - Armor: 1 (leather cloak)  
> - Attack: Dagger (light damage, advantage if in shadows).  
> - Abilities:  
>   - **Fade Into Darkness:** As a reaction, vanish into Nightveil shadows (teleport 20 ft).  
>   - **Whispered Message:** If they escape, they can alert Fanewraith’s network.  
> - Weakness: Bright light or fire reveals them.

### **Encounter 2: The Sick Animal (Investigative)**

>[!QUOTE] Encounter – Narration
A ragged cry echoes through the reeds, distant but piercing. The oxen balk, refusing to move forward. The sound comes again — long, broken, half-animal, half-human in its pain.

```encounter
creatures:
  - Bear
party:  Main Party
```

Senses:

- Sight: A massive bear slumped against a tree, fur patchy, black veins crawling under its skin. Its eyes glow faintly white.
- Sound: Labored, rattling breaths. A low growl that rises suddenly into a roar.
- Smell: Rotting meat, musk, and a faint fungal tang.
- Touch: The ground is damp and sticky with spore-laden mud.
- Taste: Bitter, acrid air — like mold spores on the tongue.

Fear Usage:

- Spend Fear to have the bear lurch into a frenzy, attacking even if it seemed weak.
- Spend Fear to make its spore cloud spread wider, forcing multiple PCs to roll.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a visceral dread — the sense that Brindle (Fianna’s fox) could end up like this.

> [!NOTE] GM Options  
> - **Investigate:** Following the sound leads to a clearing where a deer lies, blackened veins spreading across its body, eyes clouded white.  
> - **Ignore:** The sound fades. Later, the party finds its carcass on the road, bloated and buzzing with flies.  
> - **Choices at the Deer:**  
>   - **Mercy Kill:** Quick, clean — earns respect from locals.  
>   - **Attempt Healing:** Fern/Fianna might try magic or medicine. Success = brief reprieve, but corruption too deep.  
>   - **Study It:** Gnirth senses the Witherwild taint, learns it spreads like a parasite.  

> [!STATBLOCK] Witherwild-Tainted Deer  
> - HP: 6  
> - Armor: 0  
> - Attack (if provoked): Gore (light damage, chance to spread corruption).  
> - Special: On death, releases a spore cloud (Instinct save or gain a Fear Token).

### **Encounter 3: The Broken Bridge**

>[!QUOTE] Encounter – Narration
The wagon halts. Ahead, the rope bridge across a narrow fen stream has collapsed, its planks half-submerged in the dark water. The current is slow but deep, and the oxen refuse to cross.


Senses:

- Sight: Water glimmers with faint starlight, but something stirs beneath the surface.
- Sound: The creak of broken ropes, the slow gurgle of water.
- Smell: Wet rope, algae, and stagnant water.
- Touch: The ropes are frayed and slimy, the planks slick with moss.
- Taste: The air tastes brackish, like river silt.

Fear Usage:

- Spend Fear to make the current stronger, threatening to sweep the wagon.
- Spend Fear to have the ropes snap mid-crossing.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a sinking feeling — the sense that the water itself wants to pull them under.

> [!NOTE] GM Options  
> - **Repair:** Use rope, wood, or magic to mend the bridge.  
> - **Ford:** Lead the wagon through the water (risk of damage or stuck wheels).  
> - **Detour:** Find another crossing (adds time, risk of another encounter).  
> - **Creative Magic:** Freeze the water, grow vines, or use elemental powers.  

---

## **Scene 3 – Arrival at the Barracks**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 3 – Narration
The moon shines bright as the wagon crests a low rise. Ahead, you see the barracks — a squat stone fort, its walls patched with mismatched timber. The banners of Haven hang limp, their colours faded. Smoke rises from the training yard, where a handful of recruits drill under the watchful eye of a dwarf in battered armor. The place feels tired, worn — a relic of the war, still clinging to purpose.

Senses:

- Sight: Cracked stone walls, faded banners, recruits in mismatched armor.
- Sound: The bark of drill sergeants, the clatter of wooden pikes, the dull thud of sparring.
- Smell: Sweat, smoke from the mess hall, faint tang of oil and rust.
- Touch: Rough-hewn walls, splintered training dummies, mud underfoot.
- Taste: Thin gruel and bitter ale in the mess.

Activities:

- Drills: Recruits practicing pike formations, often breaking ranks.
- Combat Arena: A dirt pit where sparring matches are held.
- Shooting Range: Straw dummies riddled with arrows, some broken.
- Mess Hall: Sparse rations, propaganda posters on the walls.
- Chapel Corner: A small shrine with guttering candles, mostly ignored.

Fear Usage:

- Spend Fear to show the strain of the recruits — one collapses mid-drill, coughing dust.
- Spend Fear to have a fight break out between recruits, showing the tension.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a hopelessness — the sense that Haven’s army is a hollow shell.

> [!NOTE] GM Worldbuilding  
> - **Population:** ~40–50 total (20 recruits, 10 veterans, 10 civilians).  
> - **Drills:** Wooden pikes, mismatched armor, shouted orders.  
> - **Combat Arena:** A dirt pit where recruits spar.  
> - **Shooting Range:** Straw dummies with arrows sticking out.  
> - **Mess Hall:** Sparse rations, propaganda posters.  
> - **Chapel Corner:** Small shrine, guttering candles.

# **Monks Eliegh – The Chapel of Stone Prayers**

## **Arrival at the Town**

>[!QUOTE] Scene – Arrival at Monks Eliegh 
>The road winds down into a hollow where the town of Monks Eliegh once stood. The houses are silent, their doors ajar, roofs sagging under the weight of dust and time. A red serpent has been painted on the old watchtower — Haven’s mark of a town lost to the Sickness. The air is dry and heavy, carrying the faint scent of stone and incense. As you pass through the streets, you see them: statues of men, women, and children, frozen mid-prayer, their faces turned toward the chapel at the town’s heart. The silence is absolute, broken only by the whisper of wind through broken shutters.

---

## **The Chapel Interior**

>[!QUOTE] Scene – The Chapel 
>The chapel doors creak open, revealing rows of stone figures kneeling in prayer. Their faces are worn with grief, their hands clasped, their eyes turned toward the altar. Dust lies thick on the pews, but one thing stands out: a single candle burns at the altar, its flame steady despite the still air. At the altar, a gaunt priest kneels among the stone figures, his voice a low murmur of endless prayer. He looks up as you enter, his eyes tired but kind.

---

## **NPC – Mathias Vanta**

- **Appearance:** Old, gaunt, robes patched and worn. His hands are cracked from years of tending to stone and dust.
- **Voice:** Soft, weary, but steady. Speaks slowly, as if every word is weighed.
- **Personality:** Devoted, compassionate, but haunted. Believes the statues still hear his prayers.
- **Quirk:** Always has a candle burning in the chapel, never lets it go out.

**RP Hooks:**

- To Sabriel: _“You return, as you always do. I thank you for the supplies, though I fear it is your soul that carries the heavier burden.”_
- To the Party: _“You walk among the stone, yet you still breathe. That is a gift. Do not waste it.”_
- If asked about the candle: _“It has burned since the day they turned. I do not question it. I only keep it lit.”_

---

## **The Note**

- The folded note lies beneath the candle, half-buried in wax.
- Mathias swears he did not place it there. He thought it was just wax.

>[!QUOTE] Kreil’s Note (Chapel Version) 
>“I have been observing you through the network. Your help will be needed to avoid a great threat. Meet me at the Old Weir by next Nightveil. Bring only a trusted few.”

- Short, factual, deniable.
- If intercepted, it reveals nothing of Kreil’s identity or the Fanewraith.
- The wax dripping over it makes it feel like it’s been waiting for them.

---

## **The Five Senses**

- **Sight:** Rows of statues frozen mid-prayer, candlelight flickering across stone faces, Mathias kneeling among them.
- **Sound:** The faint crackle of the candle flame, Mathias’ murmured prayers, the groan of old wood.
- **Smell:** Dry dust, faint incense, acrid tang of old wax.
- **Touch:** Cold stone surfaces, sticky wax on the note, brittle wood of the pews.
- **Taste:** Chalky air, leaving grit on the tongue.

---

## **Fear Usage in the Chapel**

- Spend Fear to make the **statues seem to shift** in the corner of the eye.
- Spend Fear to have the **candle gutter violently** when the note is touched, as if reacting.
- Spend Fear to make PCs hear **whispers from the stone** — indistinct prayers, or voices calling their names.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **crushing weight** — the sense that the town itself is watching, judging.

---

## **Optional Variations**

- If you want to **heighten the mystery**:
    - The note could be written in **cipher** (Snicket or Fern can decode).
    - Or it could be **signed only with the serpent sigil**, no words.
- If you want to **heighten the horror**:
    - The candle could **relight itself** if extinguished.
    - The wax could drip unnaturally fast, as if time is wrong here.

## **Scene 4 – Kreil’s Hook**

> [!QUOTE] Scene 4 – Narration  
> As you move through the barracks yard, someone bumps into Snicket. A folded note is slipped into her pocket. On the back is a sigil — a coin with a serpent biting its tail, half-faded. Snicket recognises it instantly: Kreil’s mark, used in smuggling circles to mean *“trusted contact.”*  
>  
> The note reads:  
> *“The roots are stirring, and the waters carry their poison. What you saw in the fen was only the first breath. Meet me at the Old Weir before Nightveil falls. Bring those you trust — and be ready to see what lies beneath.”*  

---

## **Session 2 End Goal**

> [!NOTE] GM Summary  
> - Party bonds through shared travel challenges.  
> - They see the **state of Haven’s military** (propaganda vs. reality).  
> - They receive **Kreil’s summons**, setting up Session 3.

## **GM Notes: Using Fear in Encounters**

Fear Tokens in Daggerheart represent rising dread, corruption, or psychological strain.  

- PCs gain Fear when they:  
  - Fail rolls in tense situations.  
  - Witness horrors or corruption.  
  - Push themselves beyond safe limits.  

- As GM, you can spend Fear to:  
  - Escalate encounters (reinforcements, environmental hazards).  
  - Twist outcomes (a success comes with a cost).  
  - Trigger psychological effects (hesitation, visions, paranoia).  

**Encounter-Specific Uses:**  
- **Watcher in the Reeds:** Spend Fear to let the spy vanish more effectively, or to leave behind a false clue.  
- **Sick Animal:** Spend Fear to have the deer’s spore cloud spread further, or to infect the environment.  
- **Broken Bridge:** Spend Fear to make the current stronger, or to snap ropes mid-crossing.
