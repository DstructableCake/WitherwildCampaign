# Daggerheart – Session 2 Notes

**Title:** _The Road Through Nightveil_  
**Theme:** Trust, shadows, and the weight of the past—the journey reveals both the cracks in Haven's foundation and the bonds that form in shared hardship.  
**Setting:** The caravan journey from Stolen Fen to the border barracks, under the strange twilight of Nightveil, and onward to Monks Eliegh—a place frozen in stone and prayer.

---

## Departure from Stolen Fen

The settlement of Stolen Fen was dimly lit, lanterns hooded and fires banked low. The air was heavy with the scent of peat smoke and damp reeds. Traders moved quietly, their voices hushed, as if the night itself was listening. The Clanks in the fields stood motionless, their work paused until dawn.

At the edge of the settlement, a wagon waited—its wheels reinforced for the marshy ground, its driver a weary man with a lantern hung low. A pair of oxen snorted and stamped, uneasy in the gathering dark.

**Captain Thorne's Farewell.** Before departure, Captain Thorne found Sabriel. The old captain's voice carried the weight of regret as he spoke: "Arden. About yesterday… I should've been ready. I let the drink get the better of me, and I let you down. Won't happen again. You've got my word." Sabriel had spoken with Delilah earlier, asking if she could get a message to Ambrose in the city: "The corruption is stronger. I'm not sure how sanitized the reports are that get back to you. The last Bloodwing you saw was around 3m. Suspect they are getting more aggressive."

Thorne offered a final warning: "Nightveil's no time for travel. But if you must, keep your eyes sharp. The dark has a way of hiding more than shadows."

**Messages and Preparations.** Snicket also spoke with Delilah, along with other merchants, to see if there was additional information that could be gleaned. Nothing as of yet, but they would be in contact should anything change.

Fern and Fianna both wandered the markets to see what was for sale, various clothes, herbs, and sweets not tasted before—small comforts for the road ahead.

Gnirth attempted to use his Fungril connection to try and reach others of his kin, but to no avail. Other than Fern, nothing could be detected—a silence that felt heavier than it should.

## The Shrine and the Questions

Before taking off, the wagon driver—a man called Harlen, mid-40s, weathered and missing two fingers, short of patience but with plenty of time for formalities—departed the wagon and offered a soft prayer to a shrine to Qui'Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End.

A small wooden shrine stood near the wagon yard, draped in thorny vines and wilted flowers. A clay bowl of honey sat at its base, buzzing faintly with insects. Locals bowed their heads as they passed, whispering for safe passage through the fen.

Fianna and Fern opened up to Snicket and Sabriel about the gods and faint divinity. The party debated it openly, wondering who it was for and why anyone would still believe in the faint divinities. Fern even noticed that the offering—a clay bowl of honey—was different than what she had seen before, having worshipped Qui'Gar. The conversation hung in the air like incense, questions without easy answers.

## On the Road Through Nightveil

The wagon creaked along the narrow track, its lantern casting a pale circle of light. Beyond it, the world was swallowed by Nightveil—the strange twilight where the stars burned brighter, and the air felt thick, as if holding its breath. The reeds whispered in the wind, and every splash of water sounded too close.

After some time on the road, a low rumbling fog swept over the land. Having not seen this before, Fianna was particularly worried about it. It seemed harmless, albeit it did limit the visibility of the area to no more than far distance. The mist felt alive, carrying whispers that might have been wind or might have been something else.

Gnirth had the idea of attempting to use his ability to control water. By doing so, he parted the mist like Moses parted the red sea, opening up the path once more. But importantly, it also revealed a hooded figure ahead—standing among the reeds, still as a statue, their face hidden but their gaze palpable.

After some discussion, Sabriel called out "Friend or Foe," to which the figure vanished into the darkness. Snicket scoured where they once stood, finding footsteps leading to the location but nothing leading back. And only a single copper coin remained, thorns around the rim and an eye etched in the middle. The party determined it was some kind of group sigil, though none of them had come across it before.

---

## The Sick Bear

Soon after, a ragged cry of pain and anguish split the air. Fianna was first to reach it, through her love and care of creatures and memories of what should have happened with the Bloodwings.

Entering the thicket, she saw the large brown bear ahead of her, extremities corrupted by a black, oozing substance. She had seen this before with her companion Brindle, and the sight sent a chill through her heart. She spoke to the creature, who only asked her to help remove the pain—a plea that tore at her soul.

Not knowing how to remove the curse, she asked for support from the party as she comforted the bear, her hands gentle even as tears streamed down her face. Snicket and Sabriel tag-teamed to deal a fatal blow to the bear, their weapons finding the creature's heart with merciful precision. The bear's eyes closed with something like gratitude, and the corruption seemed to recede in death, leaving only the memory of what it had been.

Gnirth used his ability to read into the minds of the just-parted bear, seeking information on fear. To which he found the bear was outcast from its group through fear of exposing them to the infection. Alone in a foreign forest, it had been scared and fearful of what would happen, not understanding any of it—only pain and loss of control. The revelation hung heavy in the air, a reminder of what they were fighting against.

Past this, the party got back onto the wagon, and made it to the Barracks where they found a ragtag group of cadets being trained within an inch of their lives by a hardass Dwarf by the name of Valerius.

"ARE YOU BLOCKING OR ARE YOU PARRYING?!?!?" His voice echoed across the training yard, sharp and unrelenting.

---

## The Barracks and Valerius

After catching up, and some traded words of insults, Valerius was happy to see his old friend, revealing he was tasked with training up the new set of recruits as Upper Haven feared an upcoming assault from Fanewick in retaliation. Rumors and murmuring of discord were making their way around of the damage Haven had done.

The party asked to stay until Sunnar comes once more, in return they would help train the recruits, train themselves, and allow for small side tasks to be completed. In doing so, the party leveled up to Level 2—a milestone that felt earned after the trials they had faced.

Just before leaving, Gnirth attempted to use his power once more and, this time, found someone in the kitchens cleaning up after the officers.

She revealed herself as a migrant called Tybella, who felt she had been rescued by the Havenites, even if not directly. She was from the Blue Bell Tribe of Fungril, deep to the south of Witherwild. They had early knowledge of the tar-like substance that was taking over some of the creatures in the wild, and the source of it was an explosion that occurred around the time of the Sowing Eye being stolen and the permanent Spring season across the land. The connection hung in the air like a question mark—were they connected? The implications were unsettling.

## Journey to Monks Eliegh

On the road again, Sabriel explained it was another 2-3 days travel to get to Monks Eliegh. The travel was, pun intended, night and day in that it was very quiet and uneventful. Under the direction of Sabriel, it took little time—his familiarity with the paths guiding them through the fen with practiced ease.

What the group found was a town full of frozen souls of people, trapped in stone during their last actions in the town. This happened to be prayer, pointing towards the chapel. This chapel was manned by a sole person, Mathias Vanta.

---

## The Chapel of Stone Prayers

The road wound down into a hollow where the town of Monks Eliegh once stood. The houses were silent, their doors ajar, roofs sagging under the weight of dust and time. A red serpent had been painted on the old watchtower—Haven's mark of a town lost to the Sickness. The air was dry and heavy, carrying the faint scent of stone and incense.

As they passed through the streets, they saw them: statues of men, women, and children, frozen mid-prayer, their faces turned toward the chapel at the town's heart. The silence was absolute, broken only by the whisper of wind through broken shutters.

The chapel doors creaked open, revealing rows of stone figures kneeling in prayer. Their faces were worn with grief, their hands clasped, their eyes turned toward the altar. Dust lay thick on the pews, but one thing stood out: a single candle burned at the altar, its flame steady despite the still air. At the altar, a gaunt priest knelt among the stone figures, his voice a low murmur of endless prayer.

A kindly, gentle voice reassured the party. Mathias was very happy to see Sabriel was safe, but concerned about the burden he carried on himself. He also revealed that a halfling that matched the description of Fianna's father came to him, seeking help for matters revolving a God—Nikta, the Great Owl.

This was something Mathias could not help with, but he provided shelter and food where possible as a matter of course. Last he heard, the man was heading to Haven, though he was not sure he would find the information he seeks there.

Sabriel's old house still stood, well-kept compared to the rest of the ruined village—a small island of care in a sea of stone.

Snicket spoke privately with Sabriel about the mysterious note she had received, knowing he had ties to Kreil. The conversation was hushed, carrying the weight of secrets shared in shadows.

Gnirth attempted to commune with one of the statues, but instead cracked its head, shattering it. Fear was rolled, the sound of breaking stone echoing through the silent chapel like a gunshot.

Fern placed a memento on another statue, only for the body to crumble under her touch—dust and fragments falling away as if the stone itself was too fragile to bear the weight of memory.

Sabriel confided in Mathias about his endless pilgrimages. Mathias urged him to see this as a chance for change: "Even a small stone can turn a river in time."

Sabriel revealed to the group that he was one of the few who returned from the war, after Snicket had embellished tales of his past. The admission hung in the air, heavy with the weight of survivors' guilt.

Gnirth admitted his accident with the statue to Mathias, who accepted it with quiet sadness—a priest who had learned to find peace in imperfection.

Donning his old armor, Sabriel prepared to leave. Snicket then shared the contents of the note, and the group agreed to travel to the Old Weir.

## Kreil's Message

The session ended with Mathias speaking to Snicket, telling her that he had been asked to pass on a letter to a person matching her exact description, having been told she would arrive within a few days (around now).

The letter read: "I have been observing you through the network. Your help will be needed to avoid a great threat. Meet me at the Old Weir by next Nightveil. Bring only a trusted few."

The Old Weir could be found to the west of here, no more than a few hours travel. Very much out of the way, but a perfect place for secrecy, having been abandoned many years before.

The weight of the invitation settled over them like a cloak, the promise of answers mixed with the certainty of danger. The road ahead was clear, but what lay at its end remained shrouded in shadow.
