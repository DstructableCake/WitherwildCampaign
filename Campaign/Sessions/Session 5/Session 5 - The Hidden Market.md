# Daggerheart – Session 5 Notes

**Title:** Veins of the Fen  
**Theme:** Fading safety, personal echoes, and the wild's first grasp—Nightveil's veil pulls at hidden doubts, turning stars into watchful eyes.  
**Setting:** Onset of Nightveil's 7-day twilight from Monks Eliegh into the border fens (first 2-3 days of travel, extending toward Low Passage and a glimpse of Riverwalkers). Perpetual starry dusk cloaks paths, bioluminescent fungi flicker like false hopes, and mists veil Witherwild's subtle advance—Haven's patrols thin to ghosts, wild whispers grow bold.

## Chapel Recovery & Nightveil Departure

The session unfolded in the dim nave of Monks Eliegh's chapel, where the long rest had drawn to a close amid the faint scorch marks left by Fern's shattered summoning circle. Fern, marked by permanent dark stains beneath her eyes like shadowed tears, shared the harrowing details of her vision—the choking gasoline, clinging earthly bile, and the vast black ocean leading to a thundering cosmic warning of inevitable return. Mathias listened intently before urging a message to Ambrose in Haven, suggesting Bolgin's resurgence as a dire sign. Sabriel, drawing from fragments of ancient lore, spoke of Shun'Aush the granite ophid who once ruled the northern Witherwild, weaving this into a broader debate that echoed through the group—questioning the gods' benevolence against Haven's rulers, pondering divine favor versus mortal hierarchy, and weighing the moral cost of power in a world of imbalance.

Before setting out, Sabriel arranged for guards to watch over Monks Eliegh, easing Mathias' vigil and earning quiet thanks. Whispers among the others turned to Gnirth's failed commune with a shattered statue, its lack of memories fueling theories that the petrified might linger in limbo, a revelation that stirred both hope and horror. With rations bestowed by Mathias, etched with simple wards to sustain the road ahead, the party stepped into Nightveil's embrace, the chapel receding as starry dusk claimed the fen.

## Nightveil Travel Montage & Hunter's Camp

The journey pressed forward under Nightveil's unending starry veil, the fen's paths winding through reeds that leaned in with subtle menace, their blooms unfurling as pale guides in the perpetual dusk. Two days blurred in the hush, mists swallowing Haven's distant patrols and leaving black-veined prints like scars on the mud, while nocturnal calls wove into the wind's low murmur. Beauty flickered in the blooms' dance, their light tracing fleeting patterns on the water, yet an ominous undercurrent lingered in the distant howls and shifting shadows.

A campsite pierced the gloom ahead, lanterns swaying around a mired wagon where cages rattled with muffled distress, shadows cloaking the rough figures by the fire. Fianna slipped forward in stealth to observe, while Snicket, Gnirth, and Fern approached as travelers seeking warmth, with Sabriel holding back. The hunters revealed their grim trade—caged wildlife twisted by Witherwild taint, beasts bearing black veins and pleading eyes, bound for Haven's border labs in pursuit of Sickness cures through rumored experiments. As distraction held, Fianna unbolted a cage, unleashing the creatures in a clamor that shattered the night.

Arrows flew in retaliation, but the group scattered into the woods, evading the hunters' pursuit through the mists and regrouping on the trail. The moral weight of the act lingered, the freed beasts' distant cries a faint echo, affirming Fianna's protective instincts yet hinting at repercussions from those who profit in the dark.

## Low Passage Arrival & Night Market

Deeper into Nightveil's shadows, Low Passage appeared as a yawning maw of tangled roots and star-reflected pools, its tunnels braced by creaking wood and etched with slyborne runes that flickered under bloom-light. Snicket's keen eyes traced the hidden markers, guiding the party through narrow, flooded passages where agility was key to avoid slips into deeper waters or minor root-snares. The market emerged in a cavernous root-hall, stalls of woven reed perched on platforms, lit by swaying bloom-lanterns amid the hum of muffled barters and dripping echoes.

Exploration yielded a variety of Nightveil wares, with the party acquiring several potions for handfuls of gold each: 

- Fenmoss Poultice to regain health and restore stress during rests; 
- Dew of Oove to remove minor conditions and resist Wither damage; 
- Reedwine Draught for social bolstering with a crash afterward; 

Other available potions included:

- ⁠Stride Potion - You gain a +1 bonus to your next Agility Roll.
- Enlighten Potion - You gain a +1 bonus to your next Knowledge Roll.
- Minor Health - Clear 1d4 HP.
- Minor Stamina - Clear 1d4 Stress.
- Control Potion - You gain a +1 bonus to your next Finesse Roll.
- Bolster Potion - You gain a +1 bonus to your next Strength Roll.

And weapons/ armours:

- Improved version of your current armor
- Parrying Dagger
- Returning Axe
- Spiked Shield
- Harrowbone Armor
- Runetan Floating Armor

Sabriel traded tales of the wilds' perils for warnings of sparse flora ahead and brittle tensions at the divide. Tensions were heightened, with risk of attacks looming.
Snicket delved into ledgers, uncovering tampered records of Veil distributions that hinted at hidden diversions, setting her instincts alight. 

Deeper alcoves tempted with greater risks—a locked chest humming with wards, guarding relics that whispered power, while cipher scrolls and taint-vials promised advantages against the dark. The market's pulse thrummed with opportunity, its slyborne guardians watchful as the party gathered their finds before pressing onward.

The session ended there, a calm before the impending storm.
