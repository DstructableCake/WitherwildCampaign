### Session 5 Prep: "Veins of the Fen"

**Title:** Veins of the Fen  
**Theme:** Fading safety, personal echoes, and the wild's first grasp—Nightveil's veil pulls at hidden doubts, turning stars into watchful eyes.  
**Setting:** Post-rest in Monks Eliegh as Nightveil begins its 7-day twilight, journey into the border fens (first 2-3 days of travel, extending toward Low Passage and a glimpse of Riverwalkers). Perpetual starry dusk cloaks paths, bioluminescent fungi flicker like false hopes, and mists veil Witherwild's subtle advance—Haven's patrols thin to ghosts, wild whispers grow bold.  
**One-Line TL;DR (GM Goal):** Begin with recovery RP tying Fern's vision and party status, then immerse in Nightveil's onset during travel with a moral test, weaving Snicket/Gnirth hooks toward Low Passage exploration and a villain tease, teasing Riverwalkers to build multi-session momentum (3 hours: 30 min chapel/RP, 60 min travel/moral test, 40 min Low Passage/market, 50 min campfire/Riverwalkers teaser/cliffhanger).  
**High-Level Beats (Timed for ~3 Hours):**

1. **Chapel Recovery & Nightveil Departure (30 min):** Post-rest ties and environmental send-off.
2. **Nightveil Travel Montage & Hunter's Camp (60 min):** Atmospheric journey with moral test.
3. **Low Passage Arrival & Night Market (40 min):** Navigation and intrigue.
4. **Campfire Encounter & Riverwalkers Teaser (50 min):** Probing interaction and session-end glimpse.

**Title Card Quote:**

#### Scene 1: Chapel Recovery & Nightveil Departure

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
Within Monks Eliegh's stone embrace, the chapel stands as sentinel to the shifting wilds, its pews bearing the faint scorch of a recent fire and the acrid echo of fern's ooze where the summoning circle shattered. The long rest has passed in fitful vigil, the party's wounds knit by time and Valerius' kits awaiting their use, though Sabriel's lingering aches speak of battles not yet fully mended. Fern stirs from her collapse, the vision's weight etched in the pallor of her skin and the faint, vanished tar that marked her form—now a stain on the altar floor, its edges curling like roots in the dim. Stars pierce the windows without dawn's rise, their light a stark boundary as Nightveil claims the sky, blooms beginning to unfurl along the thresholds with Oove's subtle glow, whispering of the seven days where shadows name their own. Mathias moves quietly among the statues, his candle a steady anchor in the nave, where incense clings to the air like a half-forgotten prayer.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Candle flame steady against starry intrusion, tar-stain's dark curl on stone, shadows lengthening as blooms flicker outside.
- **Sound:** Hushed nave, Mathias' soft footfalls among statues, first fen winds murmuring through cracks.
- **Smell:** Incense's dry fade mingling with the night's cool, incoming moss from the wilds.
- **Touch:** Pews' worn wood under hand, night's edge seeping through stone like an unyielding tide.
- **Taste:** Chapel air's herbal remnant, touched by the first chill of Nightveil's breath.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- Post-Rest Tie-In: The long rest has concluded, but Fern's collapse leaves subtle marks—the tar-stain remains on the floor, its acrid scent a faint undercurrent, while Sabriel's unhealed health lingers in the chill. Mathias tends the space, his presence a quiet constant amid the statues.
- RP Wrap-Up: Opportunity to address the vision's aftermath, any kit preparations (upgrades require a dedicated long rest action), and party plans for the road ahead. Kreil's map rests on a pew, its star-inscribed edges catching faint bloom-light from outside—Snicket's note glimmers nearby, while Gnirth's pool ripples subtly under starry windows.
- Mathias' Offer: He provides a bundle of rations etched with simple wards, a Nikta prayer bead, and lore on Nightveil's onset, speaking of Oove's blooms as fleeting guides in the seven days to come.
- Prompt Agency: What words or actions mark the threshold before Nightveil's stars claim the fen?

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- The tar-stain aligns with a statue's base, its shadow stretching under emerging stars as if roots seek the night—Oove's blooms flicker along the chapel eaves, a ward against Qui’Gar's stirring thorns.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend for a bloom's flicker outside (illusory star-fall path—gains 1 Fear, evokes quiet warning from the wilds). Limit to 1 token.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** The tar-stain darkens under stars—what vision's remnant lingers as light fades?
- **Fianna:** The prayer bead awaits in the bundle—what kin-hope does it hold against the veil?
- **Gnirth:** The pool's ripple strengthens—what void's pull stirs with the night?
- **Sabriel:** Unhealed aches sharpen in the chill—what duty's edge meets this threshold?
- **Snicket:** The map's note gleams faintly—what slyborne whisper calls from its lines?

**GM Options / Variations:**

- RP Slow? Nudge with mists gathering at the door.
- Variation: Sabriel's low HP—Chill of the stone nave tests endurance.

**Transition Line:** The chapel door creaks wider into Nightveil's starry hush, the fen's mists drawing near—reeds part like unspoken invitations, the path ahead woven with bloom-faint glows.

#### Scene 2: Nightveil Travel Montage & Hunter's Camp

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
As the party ventures from the chapel's stone into Nightveil's embrace, the fen unfolds under its seven-day shroud, stars wheeling in fixed array without Sunnar's mercy, casting the world in perpetual dusk where shadows hold sway over forgotten warmth. Paths wind through reeds that seem to lean inward, their tips blooming with Oove's pale lanterns—subtle glows that mark safe steps amid the yielding mud, though the ground exhales damp sighs hinting at deeper disturbances below. Haven's patrols manifest as fleeting phantoms, their campfires swallowed by encroaching mists that carry the first night's chill, leaving behind only the faint, black-veined prints of boots as if the earth resents intrusion. The air thickens with the scent of wild herbs laced by subtle rot, blooms unfurling to light the way, their patterns a fleeting beauty that dances between revelation and snare, while nocturnal eyes gleam from the thickets, a chorus of calls blending into the veil's relentless hush.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Stars fixed in unnatural array, bloom-pulses casting elongated shadows on bog-veined paths, distant camp lanterns swaying faintly.
- **Sound:** Waters' laps infused with undertones not of this depth, reeds' susurrus carrying half-heard geometries of speech, cage-rattles echoing from the camp.
- **Smell:** Moss laced with an undernote of abyssal damp, blooms' sweetness veering toward the indescribable, stew's savory drift from the fire, undercut by caged musk.
- **Touch:** Mist's persistence like unseen tendrils, ground yielding with reluctant patterns underfoot, night's subtle weight pressing close.
- **Taste:** Night air's chill edged with metallic unfamiliarity, as if stars themselves exhale, blending with camp's hearth-notes.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- Travel Montage Focus: Nightveil holds two days in twilight's grip—stars wheel without dawn, mists veil patrol-lights into phantoms, leaving black-veined marks. Group Finesse/Stealth opportunity (DC 11, player-initiated): Navigate veil-hidden turns.
- Lead to Hunter's Camp: A roadside cluster of tents around a fire, cages rattling softly—hunters' wagon laden with muffled forms, their lanterns dim under starry hush; wagon's purpose evident in scribbled tags ("Haven-bound samples").
- Event: Camp holds a moral test—caged wildlife (tainted creatures, e.g., 2-3 small beasts like scale-squirrels or thorn-bats, showing Wither signs similar to Brindle) destined for Haven's fringes (rumored experiments tying to Sickness cures). Hunters appear rough, their intent clear from overheard talk (e.g., to border labs for coin); animals huddle in distress, eyes gleaming with confusion, veins pulsing like Brindle's curse.
- Moral Test Opportunity: Fianna may sense the creatures' plight (Druid communion reveals ignorance-driven cruelty—e.g., "Unnatural cage... caged like Brindle, hunger calls from within, not wild's way"—hints Brindle parallel); party can question (Presence to probe kindness) or intervene (stealth to free, combat to confront).
- Taint Hint: Creatures' veins match Gnirth's void markings subtly (Arcana probe: Echo of "flood-born chaos," teasing his grove origin without reveal).
- Resolution: Aid animals (moral win—creature ally or escape clue); ignore (hunters press for info, risking conflict); exploit (hunters share wary tale of "Haven's curdled demand," tying Snicket's family/smuggling roots to Haven's desperation).

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Blooms along the path unfurl in star-patterns, some veined black—the cage-rattles carry a faint, chaotic echo, hinting submerged floods.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low/Medium:** Spend for cage-murmurs amplifying doubts (e.g., Brindle's voice in a cry—1 Fear gain evokes hidden promises). Total: 2-3 tokens.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Snicket:** Camp lanterns name old debts—what slyborne echo rises from the cages?
- **Gnirth:** Creatures' veins mirror depths—what void surge stirs in their cries?
- **Fern:** Blooms frame the wagons—what imbalance's call lingers in the taint?
- **Fianna:** Cages rattle with unrest—what protection's urge cuts through?
- **Sabriel:** Fire's edge wards the camp—what oath's line forms amid the peril?

**NPC: Rorik the Lead Hunter (Human Wildborne, Ranger)**

- **Appearance:** Burly, scarred arms from vine-thorns, thorn-wrapped bow.
- **Voice:** Gruff bark, laced with bitter humor.
- **Personality:** Opportunistic pragmatist—views taint as "nature's edge" to exploit for Haven coin, blind to cruelty.
- **Soundbites:** "These mutts fetch good coin back at Haven's labs—cure for their own curse, they say." / "Night's no place for soft hearts; weak beasts serve a greater turn."

**NPC: Sylva the Trapper (Faun Slyborne, Rogue)**

- **Appearance:** Lithe, patched leathers, handles cages with efficiency.
- **Voice:** Hushed rasp, evasive.
- **Personality:** Greed-driven enabler—poaches for profit, resents Haven but profits from their desperation.
- **Soundbites:** "Haven's experiments pay better than their lives are worth to them." / "Eyes on the cages, stranger—taint's a gift if you know where to sell."

**NPC: Tessa the Handler (Elf Ridgeborne, Warrior)**

- **Appearance:** Stone-faced, iron cuffs for wrangling beasts.
- **Voice:** Blunt commands, weary undertone.
- **Personality:** Hardened survivor—lost kin to Sickness, rationalizes trapping as "delivering mercy to the mutts."
- **Soundbites:** "These things ain't natural anymore—Haven's the ones who broke 'em. We just clean up." / "Free 'em, and what? Let 'em spread? Labs take care of that for coin."

**GM Options / Variations:**

- Test Varies: If ignored, hunters boast of "Haven's endless demand" (Snicket lead to black-market cure parallels); confrontation adds light combat (poachers flee if outnumbered).
- Variation: Sabriel's low HP—Strain of watching caged taint tests atonement (prompt intervention choice).

**Transition Line:** The camp's fire dies low behind, the fen's bogs deepening as Nightveil's stars wheel on—the path to Low Passage gurgles ahead, mists parting for lanterns unseen.

#### Scene 3: Low Passage Arrival & Night Market

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
The bog-entrance of Low Passage yawns from the fen's edge, a threshold of tangled roots arching like forgotten gates over star-veined pools, where waters lap with a rhythmic insistence beneath Nightveil's unchanging stars. Wooden struts brace against the earthen walls, their timbers creaking like labored breaths, while slyborne runes etched into roots and reeds flicker in the blooms' pale luminescence—symbols that twist just beyond easy sight, guarding paths known only to those who dwell in between. Mists linger heavy in the air, carrying damp rot undercut by herbal whiffs from deeper in, and the first tunnels narrow into flooded passages, their slick stones reflecting starry fragments like scattered jewels in the veil's hush. Distant lantern-flickers promise the market ahead, their lights weaving through the mist like lures in the depths, where the underground river's murmur echoes faintly, as if the earth itself trades whispers with the night.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Star-veined pools at the entrance, root-maw arched overhead, lantern flickers casting asymmetric shadows on etched runes; deeper, tunnels open into root-halls lined with glowing fungi.
- **Sound:** Gurgling depths and reed susurrus from entrance, evolving into cleric market hums—haggling voices, water drips, muffled haggling and occasional tool-clink echoing through struts.
- **Smell:** Bog rot mingled with herbal incense from hidden stalls, a faint metallic tang in the mist, undercut by wet stone and chlorine-like water.
- **Touch:** Slick roots and yielding mud at the threshold, evolving into damp cladding on narrow walls, water levels rising to ankles in flooded sections.
- **Taste:** Air's chill edge with earthy depth, as if secrets linger on the tongue—hint of salt from the underground river.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- The entrance tunnels widen into submerged root-halls of braced stone and woven struts, water levels varying from shallow wades to waist-deep pools that reflect flickering blooms overhead. Wooden reinforcements creak under pressure, sometimes groaning as roots shift slightly, hinting at the passage's unstable nature. Slyborne runes along key walls guide the way (e.g., "Turn left at the forked root" etched subtly), their faint glow leading to a central cavernous root-hall where the market throbs in hidden life: Stalls of woven reed and salvaged crates perch on raised platforms, lit by hanging bloom-lanterns that sway with the drip of unseen waters. Vendors hawk wares under Nightveil's perpetual dusk, the air alive with muffled barters and the wet lap of pooled runoff. Exploration reveals 5-6 main stalls, with tight alcoves for private deals—deeper back, a locked chest hums near the far wall, guarded by a subtle ward.
- Movement Challenges: Narrow, flooded sections require Agility rolls (DC 12) to navigate without slipping into deeper pools or triggering minor root-snares (failure causes minor stress or a turn to stabilize). Hidden signs—slyborne runes—offer guidance; Snicket recognizes them as "network wards" (Finesse DC 12 probe reveals safe routes, easing future stealth).
- Market Layout: Central hall branches to side alcoves (e.g., herbalist nook, relic vendor stall, shadowy back-area for "overpowered" temptations). Air hums with haggling; blooms provide erratic light but Wither veins pulse faintly in damp walls, hinting at instability (Occasional Perception DC 10 to notice roots encroaching on stalls).
- Vendor Exploration/Haggling: Players encounter 4-5 vendors buying/selling Nightveil wares (e.g., glow-infused herbs, star-aligned maps, minor potions). Standard trade (Presence DC 12 for discounts) yields basics; deeper interaction unlocks options/loot.
    - Basic: Anti-taint salves (heals 1d6 HP + 1 to Wither saves, 5 gold each, common herbs available).
    - Mid: Cipher scrolls (allows decoding of rebel marks; 10 gold, haggling via Snicket's rogue skills for bonuses).
    - Temptation: In a back alcove, a "Void-Deep Relic" (staff amplifying water magic: +1d4 to next water-based roll but risks 1 Fear on use, locked chest—DC 14 Finesse to pilfer, tempts Gnirth's urges with a subtle pull).
- Transition to Camp: Market's rear tunnels lead out, runes fading as paths widen toward open fen—distant roars hint at Riverwalkers' edges.

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Runes trace ancient waterways, now twisted by veil's geometry—a submerged vein echoes the tar-stain's ooze, hinting submerged voids.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend for root-snare pulse (whisper-illusion drags—1 Fear gain evokes hidden hungers from the depths). Total: 2-3 tokens—low, building unease in the enclosed spaces.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Snicket:** Runes name a market—what slyborne signal guides your step?
- **Gnirth:** Waters twist below—what void geometry stirs here?
- **Fern:** Blooms light the passage—what shroud's balance flickers?
- **Fianna:** Depths murmur kin—what instinct tests the root-maze?
- **Sabriel:** Tunnels press close—what oath wards the way?

**NPC: Renn the Ribbet Guide (Slyborne Scout, Neutral Opportunist)**

- **Appearance:** Short, amphibious Ribbet with webbed feet and cloak woven from dried reeds, a lantern hung from a root-strap that dangles like a fisher's bait.
- **Voice:** Gurgling rasp, like water over stones—phlegmy echoes in the damp air.
- **Personality:** Wary survivor, profit-driven but fair; trades in knowledge and goods, with a greedy glint softened by bog-weary pragmatism.
- **Soundbites:** "Passage tolls in secrets—pay with coin or tale to ease your way." / "Veil hides until it hungers; I guide for a share, no more."
- **Role in Beat:** Sells safe-route scrolls (reveals Tilde lead if bargained—Finesse DC 12 for discount); knows smugglers' bogs but resents Havendust; if pressed on morals, shares vague Dustveil grudge ("Those who hoard light deserve the dark's toll").

**NPC: Mira the Herbalist (Fungril Vendor, Mystical Trader)**

- **Appearance:** Tall, cap-like mushroom cap as hat over fungal robes, hands veined like wet wood, selling from a stall grown into the root-wall itself.
- **Voice:** Soft, resonant hum, like roots shifting in soil.
- **Personality:** Eccentric mystic, barters knowledge with whimsy but eyes deals shrewdly—balances profit with cryptic warnings about "roots that remember."
- **Soundbites:** "These salves from bloom-hearts mend what dust breaks—take one, share a secret in return." / "The deeps offer depths, but the deeps demand respect."
- **Role in Beat:** Offers anti-taint salves and minor potions; if Fern probes (Fungril kinship), discounts and shares network rumor (Tilde's package "travels thorny paths").

**NPC: Jek the Relic Dealer (Human Slyborne, Shady Opportunist)**

- **Appearance:** Hooded figure with ratty cloak hiding scarred hands, stall cluttered with shadowy curios under a hovering bloom-lantern.
- **Voice:** Sly hiss, like steam from cracks—evasive, laced with underworld cant.
- **Personality:** Greedy dealer in relics and forbidden wares, all smiles but eyes sharp for cheats; pushes "exotic" items with tall tales.
- **Soundbites:** "Nightveil's gifts ain't all pretty— this cipher scroll decodes a fortune, but only if you know the locks." / "Relics from the roots—buy low, dream eternal."
- **Role in Beat:** Sells cipher scrolls (10 gold, +1 to intrigue rolls); tempts with the Void-Deep Relic (lock tempts rogue skills—DC 14 Finesse to steal, whispers offer it "freely" to Gnirth-types for "balance's sake").

**NPC: Tess the Informant (Elf Underborne, Wary Refugee)**

- **Appearance:** Lean, mud-caked boots and cloak, eyes darting like a cornered hare, tending a stall of scavenged goods in a dim alcove.
- **Voice:** Urgent whisper, edged with desperation—quick bursts when haggled, falling silent at danger.
- **Personality:** Bitter refugee from Sickness-fringes, trades tales for coin; sympathetic to underdogs but paranoid from perils.
- **Soundbites:** "These taint-vials lighten the shadows, but eyes watch the depths closer now." / "Heard of a package? Whispers say Tilde hoards more than vials—roots run deep."
- **Role in Beat:** Sells basic wares cheaply to sympathetic ears (e.g., salve for 4 gold via Presence DC 12); haggles reveal shady rumors (e.g., Tilde's connection to "thorn-walkers" like Fanewraith, or veiled threat about "eyes in the walls" for greed).

**GM Options / Variations:**

- **Navigation Challenges Slow?** Offer a rune-guided shortcut (group Knowledge DC 12: Speeds by, but reveals a minor Wither vein—earn edge vs. corruption).
- **Haggling/Exploration Varies:** Standard trades base on haggling (Snicket's rogue Finesse/Finesse for discounts); deeper rolls (DC 13 Presence/Insight) unlock lore (e.g., "Thorn-walkers seek taint-vials for their rites—reeks of deeper roots").
- **Loot Temptation Focus:** Void-Deep Relic pushes greed/morals—staff details emerge on touch (water-amplifying: +1d4 to Gnirth's sorcery, but 1 Fear on use—describe as "cold metal humming like buried water"); chest lock invites attempts (success: Gain item; failure: Minor ward zap, +1 Fear).
- **Variation (Moral Edge):** One stall sells "caged whispers" (minor Wither-trinkets)—Fianna spots taint (Druid sense: Links to Brindle, optional free act risking vendor alert).
- **Variation (Gnirth Tie-In):** A "flood-relic" vial tempts (his voice: Urge to submerge for "renewal"—probe reveals void-hum, hinting origin without reveal).
- **Time Short:** Condense to 1-2 vendors (e.g., Renn + Jek)—focus Snicket's spotlight for quick ties; loot offers quick grabs.

**Transition Line:** Lanterns sway as stalls recede, the passage yielding to open fen—campfires beckon amid the veil's hush.

#### Scene 4: Campfire Encounter & Riverwalkers Teaser

>[!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud 
The fen clearing unfolds under Nightveil's unchanging canopy, where a lone campfire crackles with steady warmth, its dance illuminating an elderly traveler—wizened features shadowed beneath a hood, her simple robes woven with faded thorns, as she stirs a pot of herbal stew over flames that pop and sigh like old tales shared in quiet. Blooms encircle the site, their soft pulses weaving light through the reeds, while the ground yields to dew-soft grass marked by faint cart tracks. The air thickens with the stew's inviting aroma, herbs mingling with bog damp, and distant riverbanks beckon from the east, their meadows alive with subtle grazes under starry vigil.

[[Elowen Portrait.png]]

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Firelight flickers on the traveler's hooded form and bubbling pot, blooms pulsing in soft rings around the clearing; distant riverbanks show starlit meadows with shadowy herd shapes and glittering blooms under the eternal dusk.
- **Sound:** Flames' crackle and pot's gentle simmer underscore the traveler's low hum, blending with subdued reed-rustles; distant roars from riverbanks layer into uneasy melodies, growing thunderous as something stirs.
- **Smell:** Herbal stew's savory steam rises invitingly, undercut by bog's earthy rot; river winds carry faint musk from the banks, laced with overripe floral sweetness from siren blooms.
- **Touch:** Fire's radiating warmth cuts the night's chill, dewy grass yielding softly underfoot; distant rumbles vibrate the ground like approaching tremors.
- **Taste:** Stew's herbal promise lingers on the tongue, night's crisp edge sharpening the air's subtle wild tang from the nearby river.

**Setting & Immediate Beats:**

- The clearing serves as a momentary haven, circled by bio-luminescent blooms that pulse with Oove's faint guidance, their glow revealing scattered travel signs—faded cart tracks and reed bundles—but also faint thorn scratches nearby, as if Qui’Gar's touch lingers even here.
- The traveler, an elderly Wickling woman named "Elowen," beckons with a weathered hand, offering stew and space by the fire without question, her eyes kind yet sharp as she gauges the party's weariness and origins through casual talk.
- Riverbanks east tease the horizon, meadows lush with starlit grazes, but subtle discord grows—sirens from blooms draw distant shadows, building to a rumble that hints at stirring beasts.

**Optional Lore Implications:**

- Elowen's herbal knowledge hints at Fanewick's eternal spring woes, her words skirting Veilshade whispers ("Thorns bloom where balance breaks") without naming factions.
- Blooms around the fire echo Hyacynis' erratic gifts, their edges veined faintly, tying to broader corruption without direct exposition.

**Fear Usage:**

- **Low:** Spend to make the fire's warmth flicker erratically, illuminating a bloom's black vein that seems to "reach" toward the party (gains 1 Fear, feels like a fleeting touch of watchful roots from the night).
- **Medium:** Spend to have distant roars swell unnaturally, causing illusions of shifting shadows that mimic party members' fears briefly (gains 1 Fear, feels like an intimate chill, as if the veil knows unspoken doubts).
- **High:** Spend to trigger a sudden bloom-pulse surge, briefly animating a nearby reed as a thorny snare that grabs at gear (gains 2 Fear, feels like the ground's subtle rejection, roots coiling in the mind's eye).

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Fern:** These blooms pulse with familiar unseen hands—what hedge balance do you sense in their light, and how do you weave a thread to test it?
- **Fianna:** The stew's steam carries a familiar natural tang—what instinct does it stir in you, drawing on your bond with all creatures under the veil?
- **Gnirth:** The fire's reflection twists in the pot's water—what void urge does it summon, and do you let elemental flow probe its depths?
- **Sabriel:** The flames' steady glow feels like a ward—what unhealed memory does it evoke, calling your knight's resolve to the fore in words or watch?
- **Snicket:** Smoke trails from the pot like shadowed lanes—what slyborne instinct pinpoints the wholesomeness of this shared warmth?

**GM Options / Variations:**

- **Probing Focus:** If players share little, Elowen offers herbal lore freely (e.g., "Blooms like these saved me from a Nightveil chill once—yours remind me of stars above the Whitefeather glade"); if they open up, she shares more (e.g., "Fanewick's wilds hold many seekers—some chase eyes, others kin lost in the thorns, like a halfling I knew who wandered east for revenge").
- **Informative Layer:** Keep probes casual—Elowen shares border tales (e.g., "Haven's roads grow thornier, drawing folk who owe the shadows coin"), revealing Alula snippets (e.g., "Under-canopy whispers of a rite where eyes turn skyward—Nikta's gaze watches close") without suspicion (her disguised laugh warm, eyes twinkling like a kindly aunt).
- **Escalation Safety:** If confrontation arises (e.g., suspicion from a failed Insight), she excuses herself into mists without fight, leaving a harmless "gift" (herb pouch—actually untainted, to seed trust for future encounters).
- **Time Saver:** If RP lingers, steer to river tease via environmental cue (e.g., "A rumble rolls from the banks, blooms trembling").

**Transition Line:** The stew cools in the pot, embers glowing low as the traveler's tales fade into the night's hush—yet from the riverbanks, a deeper rumble stirs, blooms pulsing in warning rhythm.

---

**End-of-Session Hooks & Choices:**

1. **Deepen the Rest:** Press deeper into Nightveil's embrace, following the traveler's lore toward the river—risks nocturnal whispers but uncovers a bloom-hidden shrine for guidance (leads to Fianna's Nikta tie, deeper exploration in S6).
2. **Chase the Rumble:** Investigate the riverbank disturbance before dawn, confronting the stampede's source amid the meadows—prioritizes action but exposes to Withered threats (tests Sabriel's defense, potential early loot like a beast-marked amulet).
3. **Veil the Path:** Skirt the banks silently, letting the rumble fade—conserves energy for the fork but allows it to "follow" as an echoing omen, building subtle dread (allows safe camp, but adds 1 GM Fear from unresolved tension).

**Rewards & Handouts:** Standard rations refresh (no mechanical change); herbal stew provides 1d4 temp HP (Nightveil warmth). Loot if probed: Fianna gains a bloom-seed (future ritual component). handout idea: Elowen's sketched "star-map" (simple parchment with thorn-marks and river notation—teases Alula routes, used for waypoint navigation).  
**Notes for Future Sessions:**

- Elowen (Fanewraith) plants subtle seeds—her "tales" may recur in echoes (e.g., S6 bards sing similar phrases), building recognition without reveal.
- Teaser: The stampede's rumble hints at Hyacinth's corrupted herds (ties Fianna's Brindle cure in S6 Riverwalkers); a surviving bloom from the fire marks a root-vein, subtly echoing Gnirth's void (future surge hint).
- Arc Tie-In: If players befriend/invest in her, she reappears as "helpful stranger" later (Strahd-like manipulation); Snicket's package weighs heavier post-talk (e.g., "Herbs like these cross borders—careful with burdens like yours").
