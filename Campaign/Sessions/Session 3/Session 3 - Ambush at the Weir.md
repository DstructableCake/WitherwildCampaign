# Daggerheart – Session 3 Notes

**Title:** _Ambush at the Weir_  
**Theme:** Secrets uncovered at knife-point; trust tested beneath the fen.  
**Setting:** From the stillness of Monks Eliegh’s chapel to the moss-choked ruins of the Old Weir, where revelations are bought in blood and smoke.

## Monks Eliegh – Stone Prayers and Old Burdens

Morning light filtered through dust as the party awoke in the ruined hamlet of **Monks Eliegh**, statues of its former inhabitants standing frozen mid-prayer. Sabriel’s old house still stood, better kept than the rest—a quiet relic from gentler days. In the chapel, **Mathias Vanta** tended his endless candle, voice low, steady, and tired. Sabriel confided in him about the long pilgrimage he could not seem to finish. Mathias’ reply was soft but firm: “Even a small stone can turn a river in time.”

In the aisles of stone, smaller moments cut deep. **Gnirth** reached out to a statue and felt it crack under his touch, the head splitting with a brittle snap—silence answering his intent. **Fern** placed a memento on another figure; the body crumbled as if memory itself were too heavy to bear. **Snicket** pulled Sabriel aside to share a note slipped to her—Kreil’s mark, and a summons whispered through the network. Sabriel admitted more than most ever hear: he was one of the few who returned from the war. The truth landed like a weight shared, not shed.

Armor buckled, blades checked, the group set out. The note’s words pointed west: the **Old Weir**.

## Through the Fen – Quiet Roads, Watching Trees

They followed familiar but overgrown tracks, the fen’s hush broken only by insects and the soft plash of water around roots. **Fianna** paused beneath a stretch of leaning birch; the trees whispered of another presence—near, intent, unseen. Hours later, they came upon two does drinking at a stream. One bore early signs of the Sickness, veins darkening beneath the skin like ink in water. Fianna spoke to them in gentler tones; the doe treated the corruption as if it were simply part of the world now. The answer chilled more deeply than any threat.

The Weir’s broken mouth yawned ahead—stonework slumped, moss thick around the timbers. The air smelled of damp iron and old decisions.

## The Hooded Figure – Names as Currency

From the ruin’s shadow, a hooded figure stepped into view, voice level and inquisitive: who were they, and why had they come? **Snicket** answered quickly, too quickly—real names given like coins slid across a table. The figure’s response was a reprimand dressed as courtesy: names are currency; spend them with care. He recited slivers of truth about each of them—things not broadly known—then turned his barbs toward Sabriel’s past. Sabriel held the line.

**Gnirth** snapped, asking for plain speech or a clear path. The crossbow came up in answer. Sabriel moved without thinking—_I Am Your Shield_—and the air shattered into violence. Blades rang in close quarters, timber and stone throwing back the sound. When the test was met, the figure sheathed his weapons and tilted his head. “Not as simple as I thought.” He gestured inward. The Weir had a heart, and it was a cave.

## Kreil Durn – The Roots of a Plot

Inside, breath fogged the chill air. **Kreil Durn** leaned against a table crowded with papers, sickly but razor-eyed. Between coughs, he sketched the edges of a conspiracy:  
- The theft of Nikta’s **Reaping Eye**, executed by his agent—the **Fanewraith**.  
- A second theft in motion: the **Sowing Eye**, vulnerable during the **Rite of the Turning Gaze**.  
- Haven’s vaults could protect one Eye, not both; the other lay tempting and weak.  
- Whispers of **Veilshade** and uprising in Haven.  
- The Fanewraith’s origin—a commoner whose family was lost to the Sickness, sharpened into a blade pointed at the elite.  
- And a personal thread: **Fianna’s father** had sought help to hunt the Fanewraith. Kreil sent him toward **Alula**.

On the Sickness, Kreil spoke of balance—how a cure might be found if the scales could be righted. Hope sounded like an argument with the world.

## The Ambush – Smoke, Stone, and Countdown

Kreil called for his guard. No answer. Then a black-tipped arrow hissed through the cave and struck home. Four assassins crashed in behind a billow of smoke.

The fight broke into three currents at once. **Fianna** transformed into a horse, scooping **Fern** and Kreil into a desperate retreat—only to falter and crash near the lead assassin. **Sabriel** went **Unstoppable**, interposing steel and scar between blade and ally. **Snicket** slid into shadow and drove a knife into the leader’s opening, a flash of precision in the chaos. **Gnirth** unleashed a brutal surge—bone crushed, flesh melted; one assassin dropped in a ruin of heat and steam.

Stone groaned. One attacker worked the cave mouth, setting charges and cracking supports—starting a countdown in falling dust. **Sabriel’s** armor split under the press, leaving him bloodied but unbowed. **Fianna** forced a path; Kreil summoned a great stag, antlers bright as winter stars, and was borne away toward Haven’s thin safety. **Gnirth** cleared rubble with water’s strength, buying seconds. **Snicket** and **Sabriel** bullied the leader toward the lip, but Snicket stumbled—left prone as the ceiling began to give. One breath. One choice. She tore the world short-distance with shadowstep and cleared the collapse as stone thundered shut.

In the ringing quiet, smoke thinned to the smell of damp earth.

## Aftermath – Coins and Consequences

One assassin still breathed. **Gnirth** steamed questions into answers until the body sagged and passed out, trussed for later judgment. A coin spilled loose in the struggle—serpent-etched, the same mark Snicket had seen before. Outside, Kreil’s guard lay decapitated, fingers locked around instructions pointing toward **Alula**. The path ahead was written in other people’s blood.

The session closed with **5 Fear tokens** still in the GM’s pool. Not spent. Not gone. Just waiting.
