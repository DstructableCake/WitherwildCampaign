### **Scene 1 - Monks Eliegh**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 1 – Narration (Waking Up)  
Dawn filters through the chapel's cracked windows, casting long shadows over the stone figures frozen in prayer. The air is still, heavy with dust and the faint scent of incense. You stir from your rest on the hard pews, the weight of the night lingering like a bad dream. Mathias Vanta kneels at the altar, his murmured prayers the only sound breaking the silence. He looks up as you wake, his eyes kind but shadowed.

**Lore Recap:**

- *Monks Eliegh was a frontier town lost to the Serpent Sickness. Victims petrified mid-prayer, leaving the chapel a tomb of statues.*
- *Sabriel's family and neighbors are among them - he fought in the invasion hoping for a cure, but returned too late.*
- *The town is marked with Haven's red serpent sigil, abandoned except for Mathias.*

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Dust motes dancing in dawn light, statues' faces etched with grief, Mathias' gaunt form at the altar.
- **Sound:** Mathias' soft prayers, the creak of old wood, distant wind through empty streets.
- **Smell:** Dry dust, faint incense, acrid tang of old wax.
- **Touch:** Cold stone floors, rough pews, brittle air.
- **Taste:** Chalky dryness in the mouth, like stone grit.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to make a **statue's eyes seem to follow** the party.
- Spend Fear to have **whispers echo** from the stone, indistinct but pleading.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **suffocating guilt** - the sense that the statues are judging them.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** Wakes near a familiar statue (e.g., a family member) - does he share a memory or steel himself?
- **Snicket:** Notices the note's sigil first - does she recognize it from smuggling?
- **Fern:** Feels a faint Fungril network pulse, like static in the stone.
- **Fianna:** Sees the statues as a perversion of Nikta's cycles - does she pray?
- **Gnirth:** Senses the "void" in the petrified forms, stirring his own amnesia.

**Mathias' Reaction to the Note**

>[!QUOTE] Mathias Vanta  
“Ah, you're awake. I... I have something for you. A hooded man slipped this under the door last night. He said it was for 'the travelers with the scarred goblin.' I didn't see his face, but he vanished into the wick like a shadow.”

- GM Prompt:
    - Let the party question Mathias (he knows nothing more - the man was tall, cloaked, silent).
    - This misdirects them to think the hooded man is the sender (tying to the agent in Scene 3).
    - If they press, Mathias adds: _“He seemed... watchful. Like he knew you'd come.”_

**The Note**

>[!QUOTE] Kreil’s Note  
_“I have been observing you through the network.  
Your help will be needed to avoid a great threat.  
Meet me at the Old Weir by next Nightveil.  
Bring only a trusted few.”_

**Transition to Travel**

- After RP, Mathias urges: _“The note feels urgent - go, before the fen wakes.”_


## **Scene 2 – Journey to the Old Weir**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 2 – Narration  
The morning light filters through the fen's canopy, casting golden shafts on the overgrown path. The trail is familiar to Sabriel, but vines and roots have begun to encroach - not enough to block your way, but a sign that time and the wilds are reclaiming what was once clear. The air is crisp with dew, and the fen reveals its beauty in the daylight: shimmering pools, flowers blooming in unexpected colors, and wildlife stirring in the underbrush.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Golden light on overgrown trails, vines creeping across paths, fantastical animals darting in the brush.
- **Sound:** Rustle of leaves, distant animal calls, the creak of the wagon (if they're using one).
- **Smell:** Fresh dew on greenery, faint floral sweetness mixed with earth.
- **Touch:** Cool morning mist on skin, uneven ground underfoot.
- **Taste:** Clean, crisp air with a hint of pollen.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to elevate stakes (e.g., a path suddenly overgrows, forcing a detour).
- Spend Fear to throw a curveball (e.g., wildlife scatters in panic, revealing a hidden hazard).
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as an **unsettling shift** - the beauty feels fragile, like it could turn dangerous any moment.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** Notices the overgrowth on "his" path - does he comment on how the fen is changing since his last pilgrimage?
- **Snicket:** Spots subtle smuggler marks on trees, hinting at hidden routes.
- **Fern:** Feels the Fungril network pulse stronger in the light, like a warning of imbalance.
- **Fianna:** Sees signs of healthy wildlife, but senses the encroaching curse - does she share a story of Brindle?
- **Gnirth:** Water in the pools ripples in response to him, stirring a fragmented memory.

**Fantastical Wildlife (Drop in 1-2 as Needed):**

- A **deer-bird** (deer body with iridescent wings) grazes near the path, then flutters away.
- **Scale-squirrels** (squirrels with shimmering fish-like scales) chatter from the branches, their tails flicking like fins.
- A **thorn-badger** (badger with quill-like thorns) snuffles through the underbrush, ignoring the party unless provoked.
- These show the fen's beauty, but hint at danger - some have faint black veins (early Witherwild signs).

**Atmospheric Events:**

1. A sudden mist rolls in, reducing visibility.
2. A flock of birds erupts from the reeds, startling the group.
3. A shooting star streaks across the sky (daytime omen?).
4. A half-sunken statue glimpsed in a pool.
5. A rusting Clank, eyes faintly glowing in the mud.
6. A patch of white flowers blooming out of season, their petals black-veined.

**Transition to the Test:**

- As the ruins come into view, the cloaked figure appears - not aggressive, but blocking the path.

---
### **Encounter: The Third Party Test**

>[!QUOTE] Encounter – Narration  
The cloaked figure steps forward, face hidden beneath a hood. Their voice is muffled, neutral. "You came. But who are you?"

- **Options (Non-Confrontational Start):**
    - **Social Test (Fishing for Info):** The agent asks probing questions ("Who sent you? What do you know of the network? Why do you seek the Old Weir?"). Success reveals loyalty; failure raises suspicion.
    - **Wits Test:** A riddle or puzzle (e.g., "What flows but never moves?"). Solves to test insight.
    - **Combat Test (If Escalated):** A quick skirmish if the party pushes - the agent dodges and disengages.

```encounter
name: Hooded Figure Test
creatures:
  - [[Master Assassin,Hooded Figure]]
party: Main Party
```

- **Sound:** Muffled voice, the rustle of their cloak.
- **Smell:** Faint oil or leather polish.

- **Taste:** Dry mouth from anticipation.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to elevate stakes (e.g., the agent reveals a personal secret they "shouldn't know").
- Spend Fear to throw a curveball (e.g., the riddle changes mid-question).

**Transition to Kreil:**

- Once the test is passed (or after a round of tension), the agent nods: "You are worthy." Kreil steps from the shadows.

---

## **Scene 3 – Kreil’s Arrival & Reveal**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 3 – Narration  
The agent nods, satisfied. From the shadows, another figure emerges - gaunt, ash-gray, leaning on a cane. "You passed. Good. We have little time."

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Kreil's gaunt face, glowing sigil on the note.
- **Sound:** His gravelly voice, the drip of water.
- **Smell:** Faint ink and dust on his clothes.
- **Touch:** The note's rough paper.
- **Taste:** Bitter tension in the air.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to have Kreil cough dust, hinting at his own corruption.
- Spend Fear to make shadows deepen unnaturally during his reveal.
- Spend Fear to have a distant splash sound like approaching footsteps.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** Kreil mentions Haven's "failures" - a chance to tie into his war guilt.
- **Snicket:** Kreil uses smuggling lingo - she might recognize a shared contact from her network.
- **Fern:** Kreil references the Fungril network - it pulses faintly, like he's connected somehow.
- **Fianna:** Kreil drops a hint about her father - she feels a pull toward Alula.
- **Gnirth:** Kreil knows of his amnesia (from spy reports of a "bog cataclysm" that warped Fungril minds) - he hints at a source tied to Fanewick's southern tribes.

**Kreil's Knowledge (Reveal Selectively):**

- **World/Threat/Task:** "The Fanewraith - Elara Voss - hides in Alula's undercanopy. She's plotting to steal Nikta's other Eye during the Rite of the Turning Gaze. Infiltrate the rebels or shrines there - they whisper her name. Stop her, or the balance shatters."
- **Fianna's Father:** "Rumors place him in Alula, not Haven. He's seeking revenge or a bargain - gathered a few trusted souls for the journey. If he's your lead, that's where you'll find him... but the Eye threat looms larger."
- **Haven/Phylax:** "Phylax masterminded the first Eye theft - ruthless, but cracking under the Sickness. Haven is stretched thin, blind to its own rot. I'm... making amends for our mistakes, in my way."
- **Dustveil/Veilshade:** "Dustveil is the corruption's shadow, twisting minds like the Sickness twists bodies. Veilshade wields it against Haven, rebels with a poisoned blade. Watch for it in Alula - it's spreading."

- **Tier:** 2 (Spymaster)
- **Difficulty:** 15 | **Thresholds:** 7/13 | **HP:** 5 | **Stress:** 4

- **Doubt Him:** He shows proof (a Witherwild vine sample).

## **Scene 4 – The Ambush**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 4 – Narration  
Kreil clears his throat. "We've lingered too long. Our watcher should be enough for any… curious eyes. Now, for the final details..." He gestures to his agent, who nods and moves towards the entrance to keep watch.

Just as his voice drops, a dull, heavy thud echoes from the direction of the entrance, followed by the clatter of loose stone. Then, silence.

Before you can react, two dark figures detach from the shadows within the ruins, moving with unnatural speed. From the darkness above, two arrows hiss through the air, streaking towards Kreil.

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Shadows within the ruins seem to coalesce into figures. Arrows flying with eerie glows.
- **Sound:** The heavy thud and stone clatter, the hiss of arrows, muffled grunts of combat.
- **Smell:** Sharp metallic tang of fresh blood, faint acrid scent of Wither taint.
- **Touch:** Cold dread, hair raising on the neck.
- **Taste:** Bitter taste of fear.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to have the assassins use the ruins for **unnatural movement** (e.g., Skulkers appear behind PCs from nowhere).
- Spend Fear to have a **tainted arrow strike** a PC, not just Kreil.
- Spend Fear to cause **Kreil’s wound to flare visibly**, making him struggle to move.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **betrayal** - the sense that even in this secret place, they are not safe.

**Player Spotlights:**

- **Sabriel:** The initial thud - a quick Strength or Instinct roll to burst towards the guard.
- **Snicket:** Recognizes the assassins' stealth tactics - a chance to outmaneuver them.
- **Fern:** The Wither taint on the arrows sparks a jolt through the Fungril network.
- **Fianna:** The assassins' cold efficiency might remind her of Haven's invasion.
- **Gnirth:** The churned water from earlier might provide an environmental hazard or cover.

**Witherwild Assassin Squad**

_**Suppressing Fire - Reaction:**_ When a PC attacks, mark a Stress. The Stinger fires an arrow, making the PC’s target have disadvantage on their next attack.

**Optional: The Guard's Fate**

- **If the recruit was with them:** You can describe him (Archer Guard or Bladed Guard) as gravely injured or knocked unconscious by the initial ambush, bleeding from a Wither-tainted arrow. He's down but not dead, needing protection.

- **Escape:** Grab Kreil and retreat through the ruins, using stealth or brute force.

---

## **Scene 5 – Kreil’s Retreat & Task**

>[!QUOTE] Scene 5 – Narration  
Kreil clutches his side, a dark, spreading stain blooming on his ash-gray coat. Black veins, like tiny roots, begin to crawl across his skin from where the arrow struck. His breath hitches.
>
"This... is Wither damage. They found me. They'll follow." He looks at you, his eyes piercing through the gloom. "I must return to Haven. But I can't be seen with you. You're compromised, but you're also my last chance."

**Senses:**

- **Sight:** Kreil's wound pulsing black, the determined glint in his eyes, the dark forms of assassins in pursuit.
- **Sound:** Kreil's ragged breathing, the squelch of his boots in the mud, the drip of water.
- **Smell:** Acrid scent of Wither poison, metallic tang of blood, the damp earth.
- **Touch:** The cold, clammy air, the rush of adrenaline.
- **Taste:** Bitter tang of combat aftermath, fear.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to make Kreil's wound **worsen visibly**, causing him to falter or cough dust.
- Spend Fear to make a **new assassin** appear from an unexpected direction, blocking an escape route.
- Spend Fear to cause the **Old Weir's structure to groan**, threatening to collapse.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **desperate urgency** - the sense that time is running out.

**Kreil’s Escape – Player Options:**  
Kreil will try to disengage, but he needs help covering his retreat. He will prioritize discretion and a clean escape over direct combat.

- **Smokescreen:** Snicket might throw a distraction (smoke bombs, flares) to cover their retreat.
- **Elemental Redirection:** Gnirth could redirect water or mist to create cover or impede assassins.
- **Brute Force:** Sabriel might stand as a shield, holding off assassins while Kreil flees.
- **Nature’s Aid:** Fern/Fianna could call on the fen itself (e.g., make reeds grow quickly, animate minor flora) to slow pursuers.

**The Assassins – Pursuit & Capture:**  
The assassins are relentless but cautious. They will try to wound Kreil and disable PCs rather than engage in a prolonged direct fight, always trying to retreat to shadows.

- **Behavior:** They move silently, communicate via subtle hand signals. They are fanatic — if captured, they bite out their tongues or take a poisoned tooth.
- **Capture:** Requires a difficult grapple (Strength or Finesse roll) or a non-lethal knockout.
- **Interrogation (if captured):**
    - They spit defiance: _"Traitors to the wild! The Root Mother watches! You'll never stop the Rite!"_
    - **Evidence:** They will have the **serpent-coin sigil**
    - **Information (Scattered):** They might babble about "Alula's undercanopy," "the Owl's slumber," or "the balance returning through thorns." No coherent plan.

---

## **Kreil’s Final Task**

>[!QUOTE] Scene – Kreil's Task  
Kreil, leaning heavily on his cane, turns to you. His voice is tight with pain, but his eyes are clear and resolute. "Go to Alula. Find the Fanewraith. Stop her before she takes the Eye. The Rite of the Turning Gaze is coming — it's the window. You have time, but not much."
>
He gestures to a faded, hand-drawn map. "This will guide you through the fen. It marks hidden paths, known patrols, and whispers of rebel activity in Alula's undercanopy. Take it. Use it. Trust no one. The shadows have ears, and the wilds have eyes."
>
With a final, pained look, he melts into the mist, leaving you alone in the quiet ruins of the Old Weir, the map clutched in your hands.

**Senses:**


- **Sight:** Kreil's silhouette disappearing, the map in their hands, the ruins around them.
- **Sound:** The silence of the fen returning, the rustle of the map.
- **Smell:** Lingering Wither taint.
- **Touch:** The rough parchment of the map.
- **Taste:** The metallic tang of uncertainty.

**Fear Usage:**

- Spend Fear to make the Wither-taint on Kreil's trail **linger visually**, hinting at its spread.
- Spend Fear to make the map suddenly feel **warm and pulsing**, as if tainted.
- If PCs gain Fear here, describe it as a **heavy burden** — the weight of the mission now resting solely on their shoulders.

---

## **Session 3 End Goal**

- Party successfully helps Kreil escape the ambush.
- They receive a **clear mission: Go to Alula to stop the Fanewraith from stealing Nikta's Eye during the Rite of the Turning Gaze.**
- They have **Kreil's map** with specific guidance.
- The session ends with a **critical choice** for the players to discuss:
    - Follow Kreil's orders to Alula (which also connects to Fianna's father and Snicket's package).
    - Or, try to deviate and pursue other goals (e.g., Haven, despite Kreil's warnings).
