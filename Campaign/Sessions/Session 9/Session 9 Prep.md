## Scene 1 – Arrival at Alula (Entry & Initial Exploration)

**Scene Type:** Entry | Social | Exploration  
**Checkpoint:** 1

> [!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
> The path climbs. Roots become stairs, in places. The river slips further and further below, its noise dimming to a distant hush. Trees here are older, broader, their trunks like pillars, their branches interlocking in dizzying webs.

> [!QUOTE] Long Read-Aloud  
> Then you crest a final rise, and the world opens.  
>   
> Ahead and above, woven into the very canopy, hangs a village of platforms and rope-bridges, huts and halls and hanging gardens. Lanterns made from bloom clusters sway in the breeze, casting soft light that dances across bark and leaf. Walkways wind from trunk to trunk, some barely visible, others crowded with distant figures moving like ants suspended in the air.  
>   
> Lower down, closer to the forest floor, you see smaller platforms—guard posts and waystations, where a few Wicklings and other folk stand watch with spears and bows. One of them calls out as you approach, voice carrying easily through the still air:  
>   
> "Travelers on the north path! State your business in Alula!"

### Senses

- **Sight**: Massive tree trunks, layered platforms, rope bridges swaying; bioluminescent blooms; faint scar where one great bough has clearly fallen or been cut (Thorngrowth hint); gate-warden with watchful eyes; distant city activity above.
- **Sound**: Creak of wood, murmur of distant voices, occasional bark of laughter or call, birds circling at unusual heights, gate-warden's challenge.
- **Smell**: Sap, leaf, cooking fires from above; faint trace of river mist below; tension in the air.
- **Touch**: Slight sway as you stand on a near-root or preliminary platform; breeze cooler at this height; sense of being watched.
- **Taste**: Crisp air; faint floral hint; anticipation.

### Setting & Immediate Beats

**Gate-Warden Challenge**:

A **gate-warden** or lower-platform ranger challenges them. This is your entry negotiation:

**Entry Options** (choose what players mention):

1. **Show Evidence** (Lute string, antler fragment):
   - Gate-warden becomes immediately interested
   - "Someone matching that description was brought in recently. A halfling with a lute. There's been talk..."
   - May mention execution plans if asked
   - Easier entry, but more attention

2. **Mention Riverwalker Names** (Silas Thornfoot, Elder Lyra):
   - "Riverwalker ground, you say? Silas sends his regards? Very well. You'll find the markets on the Heartwalk level, second tree up."
   - Easier entry, friendly reception
   - May get directions to helpful NPCs

3. **Mention Mr. Tilde** (Snicket):
   - Gate-warden gives knowing look
   - "Undercanopy business, then. The Sump Lantern knows the way. Watch your step in Shadowreach."
   - Entry granted, but marked as "underground" types

4. **Show Haven Letter** (Brill's note):
   - Gate-warden becomes suspicious
   - "Haven business? We'll need to verify this. Stay in the lower platforms until cleared."
   - Restricted entry, watched

5. **Mention Theodore/Brindle**:
   - Gate-warden becomes very interested
   - "The halfling bard? There's been... talk. An execution is planned. You may want to speak with Elder Kaelen at the market, or visit the Hanging Hollow to see what's coming."
   - Entry granted, but execution information revealed immediately

**After Entry**:

- **Initial Directions**: Gate-warden can point to:
  - Heartwalk markets (Tree 2, 2B) - "Main trading hub, good place to start"
  - Council Chambers (Tree 1, 1C) - "If you have official business"
  - Sump Lantern (Tree 5, 5A) - "If you're looking for... certain types"
  - Hanging Hollow (Tree 2, 2A) - "Where the execution will be, if you're curious"

- **First Impressions**:
  - City feels watched (Floating Eyes, hidden watchers)
  - Serpent coins visible on some people (meaning unclear)
  - Tension between traditional and radical factions
  - Execution plans are public knowledge (happening in 2 days)

### Information to Deliver

- **Execution Plans**: Public execution in 2 days at The Hanging Hollow (2A)
- **Theodore**: Halfling bard matching description was captured, accused of treason
- **City Structure**: Three layers (Sun-Lofts, Heartwalk, Shadowreach), seven main trees
- **Atmosphere**: City is tense, watched, divided between traditionalists and rebels

### Fear Usage

- **Low**: Spend 1 Fear for a moment where a **Floating Eye** (arcane surveillance) drifts past, watching the party before moving on. The feeling of being observed lingers.

### Player Spotlights

- **Fianna**:  
  Gate-warden mentions execution of a halfling bard. How does she react? Does she reveal her connection?

- **Snicket**:  
  Spots serpent coins on some people. Does she recognize them? Does she show her own?

- **Sabriel**:  
  Notices guard structure, military organization. Does he recognize any patterns? Stone Serpent training visible?

- **Fern**:  
  Senses the city's Fungril network - what does it feel like? Balanced, corrupted, or something else?

- **Gnirth**:  
  Feels the height, the vertical structure. Does the void-echo react to the city's layout?

### GM Options / Variations

- **If players are cautious**: Gate-warden is helpful, provides more information
- **If players are aggressive**: Gate-warden becomes defensive, restricts access
- **If players reveal too much**: Information spreads, party is watched more closely

**Transition Line**:  
The gate-warden steps aside, and Alula opens before you—a vertical labyrinth of platforms, bridges, and secrets. The execution looms in two days, and somewhere in this city, Theodore waits. But first, you must navigate a place where trust is dangerous and eyes are everywhere.

---

## Scene 2 – Information Gathering (Sandbox Exploration)

**Scene Type:** Exploration | Social | Investigation  
**Checkpoints:** 2-3 (sandbox, can happen multiple times)

> [!QUOTE] Short Read-Aloud  
> Alula sprawls around you—platforms above, below, and all around. Bridges sway in the breeze, connecting tree to tree, layer to layer. Everywhere you look, there are people: merchants calling, guards patrolling, refugees huddled, rebels moving in shadows. Information flows like sap through the city's veins, but knowing who to trust is another matter entirely.

### Senses

- **Sight**: Constant movement, people on bridges, platforms at various heights, guards visible, serpent coins on some, markets bustling, shadows hiding secrets.
- **Sound**: City sounds—voices, footsteps, bridge creaking, market activity, distant music, whispered conversations.
- **Smell**: Market scents, cooking fires, people, tension, secrets.
- **Touch**: City alive around you, bridges swaying, sense of being watched, information flowing.
- **Taste**: City air, anticipation, secrets.

### Sandbox Exploration Structure

Players can visit locations in **any order**. Use **Session 9 Area Reference.md** for detailed location information.

**Key Information Hubs** (prioritize these if players seem lost):

1. **The Whispering Leaves (3A)** - Information broker, knows execution plans, rebel network
2. **The Rope Bridge Market (2B)** - Elder Kaelen often here, general information, rumors
3. **The Blooming Tap (2C)** - Neutral ground, rumors, contacts
4. **The Sump Lantern (5A)** - Smuggler network, secret routes, "Silent" Mara
5. **River's End Trading Post (2F)** - Trade information, Theodore's capture details

**Information to Reveal** (based on where players go):

- **Theodore's Location**: 
  - Beneath Hanging Hollow (2A) - from Sergeant Korbin, Whispering Leaves (3A), or investigation
  - OR in Fanewraith's Base (6C) - from "Silent" Mara, rebel contacts, or discovery
  
- **Execution Details**:
  - Timing: 2 days from now, at dawn
  - Location: The Hanging Hollow (2A)
  - Method: Hanging on vine-gallows, or thorn-growth execution
  - Overseen by: Masked commander (Evelyn)

- **Brindle's Child**:
  - Location: Refugee Quarters (5C), protected by Yara
  - Discovery: Through Yara (1B or 5C), refugees (5C), or omens (1B)
  - Story: Brindle died giving birth, child is fawn (fox/deer hybrid)

- **Evelyn's Identity**:
  - Hints: Stone Serpent fighting style, voice recognition (Sabriel), documents (6C or 1A)
  - Full Discovery: Confrontation at 6C, mask removal, documents

- **Rebel Network**:
  - Serpent coins: Identification system, visible but meaning unclear
  - Spy network: Infiltrated positions (Elder Corin, Sergeant Korbin, etc.)
  - Wither vine communication: Hidden messages
  - Surveillance: Floating Eyes, hidden watchers

### Trust Mechanics

**Building Trust**:
- Help refugees (5C) → Positive reputation with commoners
- Prove Theodore innocent → Positive with traditionalists (Elder Kaelen, Elder Mirra)
- Oppose rebels openly → Negative with rebels, positive with traditionalists
- Show serpent coin (if Snicket has one) → Rebel network access (but risky)

**Trust Risks**:
- Elder Corin (1A) - Secret rebel, may betray
- Sergeant Korbin - Secret rebel, may help if trust gained
- Thornweaver (2D) - Secret rebel, may provide equipment
- Whispering Leaves Keeper (3A) - Rebel contact, information source

### Checkpoint 2 Completion

Players complete Checkpoint 2 when they have:
- **Any 2 of 4**:
  1. Learned Theodore's location
  2. Learned execution timing
  3. Discovered Brindle's child OR learned about child's existence
  4. Made contact with key NPC (Elder Kaelen, Sergeant Korbin, "Silent" Mara, or Whispering Leaves Keeper)

**Unlocks**: Access to Shadowreach, deeper plot threads, Checkpoint 3

### Checkpoint 3 Completion

Players complete Checkpoint 3 when they have:
- **Any 2 of 3**:
  1. Discovered Theodore's location AND learned security details
  2. Discovered Brindle's child OR learned full story
  3. Learned about Evelyn's identity (hints or full) OR accessed 6C

**Unlocks**: Access to 6C (Fanewraith's Hidden Base), full execution details, rescue planning

### Fear Usage

- **Low**: Spend 1 Fear to have a **serpent coin** catch the light on someone nearby, then they notice the party watching. Paranoia moment.
- **Medium**: Spend 1 Fear for a **Floating Eye** to drift closer, observing the party before moving on. Clear surveillance.

### Player Spotlights

- **Fianna**:  
  Information about Theodore creates urgency. How does she prioritize? Does she rush or plan?

- **Snicket**:  
  Serpent coins visible everywhere. Does she use hers? Does she investigate the network?

- **Sabriel**:  
  Military structure visible. Does he recognize any patterns? Stone Serpent training?

- **Fern**:  
  Fungril network throughout city. What does it reveal? Corruption? Balance? Secrets?

- **Gnirth**:  
  Vertical city structure. Does void-echo react? Does he sense something in the depths?

### GM Options / Variations

- **If players explore thoroughly**: Reveal more information, multiple plot threads
- **If players rush**: Less information, more mistakes, higher stakes
- **If players are cautious**: Information comes slowly, but safely
- **If players are reckless**: Information comes quickly, but attention drawn

**Transition Line**:  
Information flows like water through Alula's branches. Some of it is truth, some is rumor, and some is carefully planted lies. The execution approaches, and with each discovery, the web of secrets grows tighter.

---

**Scene Type:** Discovery | Emotional | Revelation  
**Checkpoints:** 3-4 (can happen multiple times as threads are discovered)

- **If players discover threads slowly**: Urgency increases, fewer options, higher stakes
- **If players miss threads**: Information comes from other sources, but with consequences

**Transition Line**:  
Truth is a double-edged blade. With each discovery, the path forward becomes clearer—but also more dangerous. The execution approaches, and every secret revealed is a step closer to the moment of decision.

- Major revelation (Evelyn's identity, other secrets)
- Cut to next session
- Next session: Continue from cliffhanger

### Evelyn's Identity Revelation

**If Revealed**:
- **Sabriel's Recognition**: Personal stakes, emotional moment
- **Mask Removal**: Confrontation, revelation
- **Documents Found**: Evidence, history revealed
- **Confrontation**: Direct challenge, personal history

**Emotional Impact**:
- Sabriel's reaction
- Personal stakes increase
- Moral complexity
- Connection to past

### Fear Usage

- **High**: Spend 2 Fear for execution to feel **inevitable** - time slows, every moment counts, stakes feel real.
- **Medium**: Spend 1 Fear for intervention to feel **risky** - consequences are real, failure is possible.

### Player Spotlights

- **Fianna**:  
  Father's execution. How does she react? Does she rush in? Does she try to reason? Emotional moment.

- **Sabriel**:  
  Evelyn's identity (if revealed). How does he react? Does he confront her? Does he try to reason? Personal stakes.

- **Snicket**:  
  Execution event. How does she contribute? Does she use skills? Does she help or hinder?

- **Fern**:  
  Execution event. How does she contribute? Does she use magic? Does she seek balance?

- **Gnirth**:  
  Execution event. How does he contribute? Does he use powers? Does void-echo react?

### GM Options / Variations

- **If players act early**: More time, more options, different outcome
- **If players act late**: Less time, fewer options, higher stakes
- **If players don't act**: Execution proceeds, major loss, consequences
- **If players succeed**: Different outcome, consequences, next session setup
- **If players fail**: Major loss, consequences, next session setup

**Session End**:  
Major event, consequences, new information, emotional impact, setup for Session 10. Whether Theodore lives or dies, whether Evelyn's identity is revealed, whether the party succeeds or fails—the consequences will shape what comes next.

## Modular Exploration Inserts

Use these to pad or trim session time, or add flavor to exploration:

### Exploration Insert A – Serpent Coin Observation

**Trigger**: During exploration, especially in markets or taverns

**Beat**: Party notices someone with a serpent coin. If they investigate or ask about it, the person becomes nervous or evasive. Creates paranoia.

**Fear Usage**: Low - coin seems to watch them, or they notice multiple people with coins.

**Information**: Hints about rebel network, but meaning unclear.

---

### Exploration Insert B – Floating Eye Surveillance

**Trigger**: During exploration, especially in upper levels or near important locations

**Beat**: A Floating Eye (arcane surveillance) drifts past, observing the party before moving on. Clear surveillance, but who is watching?

**Fear Usage**: Medium - eye seems to focus on specific party members, or multiple eyes appear.

**Information**: Confirms surveillance, but source unclear.

---

### Exploration Insert C – Wither Vine Message

**Trigger**: During exploration, especially in Shadowreach or near rebel areas

**Beat**: Party notices subtle patterns in vines that seem intentional. If Fern or someone with nature knowledge examines them, they might decode a message (or partial message).

**Fear Usage**: Low - message is incomplete or ominous.

**Information**: Hints about rebel communication, but requires decoding.

---

### Exploration Insert D – Refugee Story

**Trigger**: During exploration, especially in 5C or 7A

**Beat**: A refugee shares their story—Haven raid, Witherwild surge, farm conflict. Emotional moment, builds connection.

**Fear Usage**: Low - story reveals something darker, or refugee is more than they seem.

**Information**: Worldbuilding, emotional connection, may reveal information about Brindle's child or other threads.

---

### Exploration Insert E – Council Debate

**Trigger**: During exploration, especially near 1C or during council meeting time

**Beat**: Party witnesses or overhears council debate about execution. Reveals divisions, potential allies, political dynamics.

**Fear Usage**: Low - debate reveals darker plans, or party is noticed.

**Information**: Political dynamics, potential allies, execution details.
