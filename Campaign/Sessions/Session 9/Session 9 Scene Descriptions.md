## The Hanging Hollow (Location 2A) - Execution Plaza

### Physical Description

A wide, open platform built into the mid-level of a massive tree, approximately 100-200 feet above the forest floor. The platform forms a natural amphitheatre, with the tree's trunk creating a central focal point. The platform is made of weathered wooden planks, worn smooth by years of foot traffic, with natural gaps between boards that show the tree's living structure beneath.

At the center of the platform stands an execution stage, constructed from dark, twisted wood. The stage features vine-gallows—thick, living vines that have been trained and shaped into a hanging structure, their thorns carefully positioned. Several thorn-pillars stand around the stage, tall wooden posts wrapped with sharp, barbed thorns, designed for binding prisoners.

The platform is ringed by natural railings formed from the tree's branches, and multiple rope bridges connect to other platforms at various heights. Above, the canopy opens slightly, allowing dappled sunlight to filter through during the day, or creating a dramatic space for torchlight and lanterns at night.

### Sensory Details

- Preparation for execution: officials checking equipment, testing the gallows
- Hidden entrance to cells below, disguised as part of the tree structure
- Lanterns and torches being prepared for the execution event
- The masked commander (Evelyn) when present, standing tall and imposing

**Sound:**
- Murmur of crowds gathering, voices mixing in anticipation and fear
- Creak of wooden platform under the weight of many people
- Swaying of rope bridges as people move across them

- Sense of dread and anticipation in the air
- The weight of many eyes watching

**Taste:**
- Metallic tension in the air

- The taste of fear and anticipation

### Atmosphere

The Hanging Hollow is a place of public spectacle and fear. During execution preparations, the atmosphere is tense and anticipatory—a mix of eagerness from those who support the execution, fear from those who oppose it, and grim acceptance from those who have seen such events before. The natural amphitheatre shape creates a sense of being watched, of being part of a performance where the outcome is predetermined but the audience's reaction is not.

The presence of the vine-gallows and thorn-pillars adds a sense of the wild and dangerous—these are not clean, mechanical execution devices, but living, growing things that have been shaped into instruments of death. This creates a connection to the natural world that is both beautiful and terrifying.

### LLM Image Generation Prompt

Create a detailed, realistic image of a public execution plaza in a fantasy treetop city. The scene shows a wide, open wooden platform built into the mid-level of a massive tree, approximately 100-200 feet above a forest floor. The platform forms a natural amphitheatre shape, with weathered wooden planks showing years of use. At the center stands an execution stage made of dark, twisted wood, featuring vine-gallows—thick, living vines shaped into a hanging structure with thorns—and several thorn-pillars, tall wooden posts wrapped with sharp, barbed thorns. The platform is ringed by natural railings from tree branches, with multiple rope bridges connecting to other platforms at various heights. Crowds are gathering on the platform and bridges, with guards patrolling the perimeter. The atmosphere is tense and anticipatory, with dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy above. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, showing the textures of weathered wood, living vines, and the mix of natural beauty and grim purpose.

## Fanewraith's Hidden Base (Location 6C) - Secret Operational Headquarters

### Physical Description

A secret operational headquarters hidden deep within a tree hollow in the lower levels of Alula, near the forest floor (0-100 feet above ground). The base is concealed within the massive trunk of an ancient tree, accessed through a hidden entrance that appears as a natural tree formation—a hollow created by age and growth, cleverly disguised to look like part of the tree's natural structure.

Inside, the base consists of multiple chambers carved into the living wood of the tree. The walls are the tree's inner bark, still living but shaped and reinforced. The chambers include: a central command room with maps and planning documents pinned to the walls; private quarters; prison cells for high-value captives; storage areas for documents and artifacts; and hidden escape routes that lead deeper into the tree or out to the forest floor.

The base is lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow along the walls, casting an eerie, shifting light. The air is cool and damp, with the scent of living wood and the faint, metallic tang of planning and operations. The space feels both natural and constructed, a blend of organic growth and intentional design.

The living wood and bioluminescent fungi create an otherworldly feel, suggesting that this is a place where the natural and the strategic merge.

The base feels both safe and dangerous—safe for those who belong, dangerous for those who don't. The hidden nature of the location creates a sense of isolation and power, as if those inside are operating from a place that others cannot reach or understand.

### LLM Image Generation Prompt

Create a detailed, realistic image of a secret operational headquarters hidden within a massive tree in a fantasy forest setting. The base is concealed deep within an ancient tree's trunk, accessed through a hidden entrance that appears as a natural tree hollow.

## The Sump Lantern (Location 5A) - Smuggler's Tavern

### Physical Description

A damp, shadowy tavern built into the base of a massive tree in Alula's lower levels (Shadowreach, 0-100ft above ground). The tavern is constructed within a natural hollow at the tree's base, where water has collected over time, creating slow-moving pools that reflect the dim light from lanterns hanging overhead.

The interior is a mix of natural tree structure and constructed elements. Tables and benches are carved from the tree's wood or built from salvaged materials, arranged around the central pool area. The ceiling is low, formed by the tree's inner structure, with roots and bark visible. Lanterns hang from hooks driven into the wood, casting flickering light that creates shifting shadows.

The tavern has multiple levels and alcoves, with hidden passages leading to other parts of the tree or out to the forest floor. The atmosphere is secretive and coded—those who know the right phrases ("ask for shade-tea") can access hidden areas or make contact with the smuggling network.

The damp, low-ceilinged space creates a sense of being underground, even though it's built into a tree, suggesting that this is a place for those who operate in the shadows.

The presence of water and the flickering lantern light creates a sense of movement and uncertainty, as if the truth is always shifting, always just out of reach. This is a place where trust is earned through codes and connections, not through open conversation.

The area is a cluster of temporary structures built from salvaged materials, tarps, and whatever can be found or traded. Platforms are connected by rope ladders and narrow bridges, creating a vertical shantytown.

The housing is overcrowded, with multiple families sharing small spaces. Makeshift walls are made from cloth, wood, and other materials, creating a patchwork of temporary homes. Despite the desperate conditions, there is a sense of community—people helping each other, sharing resources, and protecting each other.

The archive consists of multiple levels connected by spiral staircases carved into the living wood, with platforms and balconies extending into the canopy.

Towering shelves of ancient tomes line the walls, reaching from floor to ceiling. Scrolls cascade from hooks in the ceiling, creating a waterfall of knowledge. Maps are pinned to bark walls, showing the geography of the region and the city's structure. The space is organized but overwhelming, with knowledge accumulated over centuries.

Soft glow comes from bioluminescent reading lamps that hang throughout the space, providing warm, focused light for reading.
