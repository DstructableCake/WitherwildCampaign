Session 9 Ideas

The party have just arrived at Alula.
Last session they travelled from Serpents Hope to Alula, on the way they met Silas Thornfoot and Elder Lyra.
After some talk back and forth, they continued on the road to find what was left of Theodore's lute and tracks that looked to hint at an ambush, and a scuffle, with drag maks leading back to Alula.
From what they can tell, Theodore has been captured and Brindle is missing. 

Some overarching ideas for the party over the next 2 sessions to discover and while in Alula:

- Theodore is in a cell awaiting execution, but the location of the cell us unknown
- Brindle is missing and the party is not sure where she is. It will turn out Theodore found Brindle when he set out on his travells from Fiannas grove seeking support and help after the attack on Nikta
- However, Brindle surcummed to her withering sickness and died in Theodore's arms. However she was pregnant, giving birth before she passed. This fox/ deer creature is the child of Brindle, and only a fawn, a small creature.
- Sabriels old commander Evelyn DeVoss is the one in command of Allula in the stead of the Fanewraith, whos whereabouts are unknown and a secret
- Evelyns identity is unknown to the party as she will be masked, the only time they will find after the culmination of the execution.
- I would like the death of Theodore to be a major event, a cliffhanger at the end of the second session before we break over christmas,
- Brindles child will be found well, though captured, i wont let any harm come to her before the party find her.
- The party will sort of be behind enemy lines in Alula, with no real way of identifying who is friend or foe. The assassins they killed on the way over all held a sigilled coin and uniform, so there will be a visible prescence, but i want to sow the doubt and fear while they are here, eyes are watching.
- Snicket will need to deliver her package to Mr. Tilde, as to what that is yet, im not sure.
- 


Ideas about the town itseld

- Most of the details can be found in the Alula Settlement page, but will need updating as that was done a long time ago with no input for what the players have done int he meantime as the story and journey has been fleshed out.
- Allula is a sprawling village, multilayered amongst the trees. Huts and houses will be built into the trees, with rope bridges connecting them.
- There are 3 primary layers for the players to explore, each the size of a large town/ small city:

- **Upper Canopy (Sun-Lofts):**  
    Sun-drenched platforms, lore halls, and shrines. Home to:
    - Loreborne scholars.
    - Elder Council chambers.
    - Small gardens and observatories.

  - **Mid-Level Platforms (Heartwalk):**  
    Market decks, common housing, workshops, and taverns.
    - Rope bridges connect “neighborhood trees”.
    - Trade stalls for herbs, night blooms, river goods.
    - Open market place for trade


  - **Lower Platforms & Undercanopy (Shadowreach):**  
    Shadowed walkways near the forest floor:
    - Refugee quarters.
    - Smuggler dens (e.g. Sump Lantern).
    - Rebel staging areas and Fanewraith’s Shadow Council influence.
    - Entry to the **Thorngrowth Spire** zone – a twisted treant corpse and Witherwild scar beneath Alula.

- In the Shadowreach is where the secret operating area of the Fanewraith will be
- The players will need to figure out where it is and how to gain access to it. Likely the place where Theodore will be.

### Fanewraith's Shadow Control

While the Elder Council appears to govern Alula, true power lies with Fanewraith's shadow network, operating through Evelyn DeVoss as the public face.

**Evelyn DeVoss - "The Mask" / "The Wraith's Hand"**
- Public face of Fanewraith's operations in Alula
- Appears masked, rarely reveals identity

- **Merchants**: Thornweaver (rebel supplier), Whispering Leaves Keeper (information broker)
- **Scholars**: Lorekeeper Aelric (conflicted, knows secrets)
- **Smugglers**: "Silent" Mara (knows secret routes), Mr. Tilde (black market hub)

**Serpent Coin Identification System**
- Coins marked with serpent sigil identify rebel network members
- Visible to those who know what to look for
- Meaning unclear to outsiders, creating paranoia
- Used for safe passage, information exchange, identification

**Wither Vine Communication Network**

- Used for coordination without detection

**Surveillance Points**
- Floating Eyes (arcane surveillance) in key locations

### Alula's Position in the Wider World

**Neutral Sanctuary Turned Rebel Stronghold**
- Originally founded as neutral refuge above conflicts
- Now serves as de facto capital for Fanewraith rebellion in central Fanewick
- Symbol of resistance against Haven's expansion
- Tension between original neutrality and current militant role

**Trade Hub Connecting Fanewick Settlements**
- Central location makes it natural trading center
- Connects river routes, forest paths, and hidden trails
- Trade in herbs, night blooms, rare fungi, smuggled goods
- Economic importance gives it strategic value

**Symbol of Resistance**
- Public executions demonstrate rebel control
- Message to Haven: Fanewick will not be conquered
- Message to Wicklings: Join the cause or be marked traitor
- Inspires both hope and fear

**Spiritual Center for Faint Divinities Worship**
- Multiple shrines to various Faint Divinities
- Scholars study ancient rites and weft-realms
- Spiritual authority adds legitimacy to rebel cause
- Connection to divine powers (real or claimed)

**Refugee Haven**
- Population swells with displaced Wicklings
- Refugees from Haven raids, Witherwild surges, farm conflicts
- Overcrowded conditions in Shadowreach
- Creates social tension and recruitment pool for rebels
