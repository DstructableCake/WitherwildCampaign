# Daggerheart – Session 9 Notes

**Title:** _Eyes in the Canopy_  
**Theme:** Hidden truths, divided paths, and the weight of family bonds—in the treetops, every branch has eyes, and trust is a currency spent carefully.  
**Setting:** The treetop village of Alula, a city suspended in three layers above the forest floor, where the party arrives seeking Theodore and answers about the Fanewraith's stronghold, unaware that their every move is watched and their time is running out before Sunnar's dawn.

---

## Arrival at the Gates

The path to Alula climbed steadily, the river's hush fading to a distant murmur as the treetops loomed overhead. The party approached the treetop village with purpose and caution, their mission clear: find Fianna's father, Theodore, and uncover the Fanewraith's hideout within the sprawling canopy city. But first, they had to get inside.

The entrance to Alula was guarded, watchful eyes scanning every traveler. The party split their approach—a calculated risk, but one that might allow them to blend in better with the city's diverse population.


Snicket, Gnirth, and Fianna—the latter transformed into a small cat-bat-mouse hybrid creature—approached as merchants. Their story was simple: they were delivering a package to Mr. Tilde, a legitimate business transaction. The guard listened with practiced skepticism, but the explanation held. With a nod, they were allowed passage, their merchant guise accepted.

Sabriel and Fern took a different route, presenting themselves as refugees seeking shelter. The guard's eyes narrowed slightly, but a gold coin changed hands, and the gate opened. As they passed through, the guard's gaze followed them, intense and unblinking—a warning that their presence had been noted, that they were being watched.

Snicket, ever cautious, positioned the serpent coin atop her package, a subtle signal that might grant them passage through other checkpoints. The coin's significance was not lost on those who knew what to look for.

---

## Gnirth's Disturbing Vision

As they moved deeper into Alula's lower levels, Gnirth felt the familiar pull of the Fungril network, the connection to his people that ran through roots and soil. But something felt wrong. He reached out, extending his awareness through the trees, seeking guidance or information about their path forward.

The response came as a shock.

His vision went dark, the world around him vanishing into absolute blackness. And then the eyes appeared—dozens of them, perhaps hundreds, piercing the darkness with an intensity that made his skin crawl. They were everywhere, surrounding him, their sole focus fixed upon him. The sensation was overwhelming, a feeling of being observed from every angle, of being completely exposed.

He pulled back, his connection to the network severed by the sheer weight of those watching eyes. A sense of paranoia settled over him, the knowledge that they were not alone, that something—or someone—was monitoring their every move through the very network he relied upon. The trees themselves had become eyes, and they were watching.

---

## Through the Thorned Gate

Further into the city, they encountered a thorned gate, another checkpoint that required passage. Snicket's instincts took over—she approached a guard with a bribe, her movements smooth and practiced. The guard demanded to search their belongings, his hands methodical as he opened Snicket's bag.

There, sitting on top of everything, was the serpent coin.

The guard's eyes met Snicket's, and for a moment, the air grew still. Then, with a subtle nod, he allowed them through without further question. The coin had worked its magic, opening doors that might have otherwise remained closed. But the ease of passage was also a warning—they were moving through territory where the Fanewraith's influence ran deep, where symbols held power and recognition came with both privilege and danger.

As they descended from the trees across a walkway, past the refugee checkpoint, something caught their attention below. On the forest floor, visible even from this height, a dark pulsing energy writhed and shifted—a reminder that corruption ran deep here, that the Witherwild's touch extended even into this sanctuary among the branches.

---

## The Sump Lantern Tavern

Fern and Sabriel decided that the best place to gather information would be a tavern—a hub of gossip, deals, and whispered secrets. The Sump Lantern Tavern stood before them, its entrance marked by lanterns that cast shifting shadows across the wooden walkways.

Before entering, Fianna reached out through their connection to warn Gnirth of their destination. But Gnirth's response was cautious, his voice carrying the weight of his disturbing vision: be careful. They didn't know if their connection had been compromised, if the eyes watching through the network could also hear their communications.

Inside, the tavern was a study in shadows and secrets. Fern and Sabriel found a corner table, settling into seats that gave them a clear view of the room. The atmosphere was thick with tension—shady dealings conducted in hushed tones, hooded figures slumped over tables, a card game in the distance where fortunes changed hands with each turn. Figures of all races and colors patronized the establishment, but everyone kept to themselves unless they had company. Trust was a rare commodity here.

One creature in the corner caught their attention—a figure whose eyes had been studying them with quiet judgment from a distance. Sabriel, reading the situation, simply slid a chair out from their table and looked away. It was an invitation, a sign that said welcome over, without words that might draw unwanted attention.

---

## Silent Mara's Offer

After a moment, the creature approached. It was a young female Ribbet, her face partially hidden but her skin unmistakable. She moved with a bounce in her step, settling into the offered chair with practiced ease. She introduced herself as Mara, her voice carrying a note of curiosity.

Fern introduced herself as 'Celeste,' Sabriel as 'Tarn'—pseudonyms that felt necessary in this place. Mara's response was knowing: she recognized the false names, but this was common around these parts. In Alula, truth was often a liability.

She got straight to business, her voice dropping slightly. Was they looking for work? She had jobs available, but they could verge on deadly if caught. These were opportunities only for those in need of coin or favor, for those willing to take risks.

Sabriel saw an opening. He began to barter for information, trading stories of their journey, of the battle at Serpents Hope, of the threats they had faced. In return, Mara explained how the transport delivery system worked around Alula—ziplines and pulleys that connected the different levels, operated by those who knew the city's secrets. The Astronomer's Tower had a pulley system from the base of the tree, she mentioned, a detail that might prove useful.

He pressed further, asking about Fianna's father, phrasing the question subtly by mentioning the struggle at the gate, wondering if Theodore was the only one taken. But Mara's knowledge was limited, her answers vague.

When he asked how to find the Fanewraith, her expression shifted. She didn't know, she said, and even if she did, they shouldn't seek her. Danger always followed those who asked such questions.

With that warning hanging in the air, she rose to leave, leaving behind a small card marked with her insignia—a froggy thumbprint that pointed directions to the refugee camp. It was a token, a connection that might prove useful later.

Fianna, still connected to the others, relayed the information about the ziplines and pulleys, the details about the Astronomer's Tower, ensuring that all of them knew the city's hidden pathways.

---

## Mr. Tilde's Delivery

Meanwhile, Snicket, Gnirth, and Fianna continued their journey into the Shadow Root section of Alula, navigating the winding walkways and rope bridges that connected the city's lower levels. Their destination was the shop of Mr. Tilde, a delivery that had been a long time coming.

The shop itself was nestled among the roots, its entrance marked by hanging charms and bundles of dried herbs. Inside, Mr. Tilde awaited them—a Galapa creature whose demeanor was abrupt, his words laced with sarcasm that seeped through like water through stone. But Snicket handled it with practiced politeness, brushing off his sharp edges with a rant about the state of society that seemed to amuse him despite himself.

Fianna, still in her transformed state, scurried around the shop, her small form allowing her to investigate corners and crevices that might hold secrets. But as she moved, a sensation crept over her—the feeling of being watched. A shadow seemed to move in the corner of her vision, hiding in plain sight, only visible when she wasn't looking directly at it. The presence was unsettling, a reminder that even in this shop, they were not alone.

Snicket completed the delivery, handing over the package that had traveled so far. Mr. Tilde accepted it with a nod, then disappeared into the back of the shop. When he returned, he carried something wrapped in silken cloth, its folds carefully arranged.

He presented it to Snicket, opening the cloth to reveal a dagger. The weapon was beautifully crafted, a Tier 2 blade that gleamed in the shop's dim light. It was a d8+4 damage weapon with the Reliable trait—a valuable tool, and one that spoke to the importance of the delivery she had completed.

Mr. Tilde explained that he had been asked to pass this to whoever delivered the package, though its origins remained unknown. It was a gift from a mutual party, a reward for services rendered.

Snicket pressed for information, asking about the increased number of guards in the area. Mr. Tilde's response was matter-of-fact: refugees were flooding into Alula due to the issues spreading across Fanewick. Trade routes were disrupted, bandits and monster attacks on the rise. The city was preparing for war, whether it wanted to or not.

Before they left, Mr. Tilde had one more request. Would Snicket complete a delivery for him, to somewhere else in Haven? Discretion was of utmost importance—do not lose it.

Snicket agreed, but she had questions of her own. She asked about Fianna's father, about where he might be held. Mr. Tilde's answer was chilling: every sunrise, those who are guilty of treason find themselves on the end of a rope.

The words hung in the air like a death sentence. They had only a couple of days left until Sunnar, until the sun rose and Theodore's fate would be sealed. Not much time to find him, confront the Fanewraith, and hatch a plot to escape.

Gnirth, feeling the weight of those watching eyes, tried to convey what Mr. Tilde had said to Fern in the tavern, his communication vague and cautious, aware that every word might be overheard.

---

## The Cursed Name

Back at the tavern, Sabriel examined Silent Mara's card, the froggy thumbprint a map of sorts pointing toward the refugee camp. As Mara prepared to leave, Sabriel called her back, his voice low. He asked about Elowen—the name that had been mentioned before, the elderly woman they had met at dawn.

Mara's reaction was immediate. She hushed him, her eyes darting around the tavern to see if anyone had heard. That name was cursed around this place, she warned. Be careful who you speak it to. The warning was clear: some names carried death with them in Alula.

The weight of the city's secrets pressed down on them, the knowledge that every word, every name, every question could mark them for death.

---

## The Paid Room

After some time, a Simiah bartender approached their table, his movements smooth and practiced. Their rooms were ready, he informed them, and they had been paid for by a "friend." The word hung in the air like a question mark.

Fern and Sabriel exchanged looks, suspicion threading through their thoughts. Who had paid for their rooms? Who knew they were here? The possibilities were unsettling—was it Mara, offering a gesture of goodwill? Or was it someone else, someone who had been watching them from the moment they entered the city?

They rose and followed the bartender's directions, heading into the tree itself. The interior was a marvel of architecture—a tree of such grand size that it had been hollowed out to make way for spiral stairs and rooms carved into the living wood. Down they went, the stairs winding deeper and deeper, until they were surely underground, such was the distance traveled.

Following the bartender's instructions, they navigated the corridors: down, left, down further, then to the room on the left side. The path felt like a descent into the earth itself, the tree's roots becoming walls and floors, the air growing cooler with each step.

They reached the door and paused, cautious. No sound came from within. But the door was unlocked, opening freely at their touch.

Inside was a modest room—a wardrobe, a desk with chairs made from the body of the tree, a simple bed. And sitting on the bed, watching them with dark, intelligent eyes, was a mole.

Demetrius.

The creature they had seen with Elowen at dawn, the companion who had guided her through Nightveil's darkness. He was here, waiting for them. They entered the room and closed the door behind them, the implications of this meeting settling over them like a shroud.

---

## The Hidden Passage

Hidden behind the wardrobe was a hole in the corner, dug by the mole's patient claws. Demetrius moved toward it, stopping at the entrance to look back, as if beckoning them to follow. The invitation was clear: this was a path they were meant to take.

They followed the creature through the small hole, the passage narrow and dark. The crawl was long, the tunnel extending far beyond what seemed possible. They must have been hundreds of meters from the village at this point, traveling through earth and root, guided by a creature who seemed to know exactly where he was leading them.

---

## Fianna's Disturbing Communion

Back in Alula, Fianna, Snicket, and Gnirth left Mr. Tilde's shop, needing to find a way past the guards to reach the root cellar and deliver the package. But first, Fianna had an idea. She reached out to touch the body of a nearby tree, her druidic connection allowing her to commune with the ancient witnesses.

She asked the tree where her father could be, her voice carrying hope and desperation.

The response was not what she expected.

Hunger. That was what she felt first—a deep, gnawing hunger that seemed to emanate from the tree itself. The trees were watching. Waiting. Seeking the nutrients that were coming their way at sunrise. They were waiting to feed.

"Feed. Feed. Feed. Feed."

The words entered Fianna's mind like a chant, a mantra of consumption that taxed her thoughts and caused her stress. The trees of Alula were not passive observers—they were active participants, waiting for the executions that would come with the dawn, ready to consume the bodies that would hang from their branches. The revelation was horrifying, a truth about this city that she wished she had never learned.

---

## Evading the Guards

Leaving the shop, they noticed that the number of guards had increased in the area. Their presence was more visible, more watchful. On instinct, Snicket dragged Gnirth back into the shop, her movements quick and decisive.

She immediately cast invisibility on Gnirth, the spell wrapping around him like a shroud. Then she disguised herself as an orc, her form shifting to blend in with the city's diverse population. The transformation was seamless, and they managed to make their way past the guards, heading toward the cellar to deliver the package.

The deception was necessary, but it was also a reminder of how dangerous this place had become, how every move required careful planning and quick thinking.

---

## The Root Cellar

They made their way to the third tree on the left, a structure that stood out from the others. This tree had many thick branches reaching out to host platforms further away from the trunk, elegant and firm. This was more of an architectural area, home to builders, engineers, constructors—those who shaped the city's physical form.

There was little wildlife in this area, an underlying sense of eeriness that seemed to deter animals. The absence of life was noticeable, a void where nature should have been.

They went through the access tunnels into the tree and headed down. In the middle of the space, a crane-like construct was raising a platform of goods and wares to the upper levels, its mechanisms creaking with each movement. Once they reached the bottom, they saw a desk with various tunnels heading deep underground.

At the desk sat a bespectacled elf, working deep into a ledger, a quill furiously scribbling across the page. He announced himself as the keeper of the cellar and "things," his voice carrying the weight of someone who had seen much and said little.

The party handed over the package, which was quickly hidden away from anyone who might come down. The transaction was brief, efficient, and marked by the keeper's obvious desire to be done with them quickly.

---

## The Trap

While Snicket was talking to the keeper, Fianna—still transformed as her creature—headed off down the tunnels to search for what might lay there other than storage. The passages were extensive, filled with crates, boxes, and the detritus of a city's hidden infrastructure.

But something caught her attention: footprints. They went every which way down the passages, a map of movement and activity. But one set of prints was different—they seemed to head toward a wall and then disappear, as if someone had simply walked through solid wood.

Just as she crept closer to investigate, she heard a snap.

A cage quickly engulfed her, the bars closing around her small form with mechanical precision. She was trapped, the snap echoing down the tunnels so that the elf and Snicket could not ignore it.

The keeper's expression was one of annoyance rather than surprise, as if this happened often. Fianna managed to talk him into releasing the cat-bat creature, her words persuasive even in her transformed state. They quickly left before much more nuisance could be caused, heading back up the stairs to the canopies above, the mystery of those disappearing footprints left unsolved for now.

---

## Elowen's Truth

Back in the underground passage, Sabriel and Fern had continued to follow Demetrius farther and farther into the earth. They had been crawling for what seemed like hundreds of meters, the tunnel extending far beyond the village's boundaries.

After a while, a small breeze of fresh air flowed across their faces. They had reached the end, and the tunnel opened up into the forest.

What they saw was a place untouched by the taint of the Witherwild—bush and undergrowth that grew healthy and strong, a home built into the roots of a tree, half-hidden by the ground. The smell of hearty stew filled the air, warm and inviting. The door was ajar, a warm glow emanating from within.

Fern reached out to check for traps, but none could be detected. She tried to connect with Gnirth, to share what they had found, but something was blocking her ability. To her, she seemed cut off from the outside world, her Fungril network powers silenced by some unseen force.

They entered the house, and there she was.

Elowen.

The elderly woman they had met at dawn, who had shared a meal with them, who had seemed so kind and gentle. She was here, waiting for them, her home a sanctuary hidden from the corruption that consumed Alula.

She confirmed what they had suspected: Alula was a dangerous place where the others were right now. But she had information they needed, truths that would change everything they thought they knew.

---

## The Story of Elara Voss

Elowen's voice carried the weight of memory and loss as she told them the story of the woman known as the Fanewraith. The woman she once knew as Elara was her niece, in her thirties. But the sweet girl she once knew was dead, replaced by something else entirely.

A few years ago, there had been an assault on their lands. Elara was already a skilled hunter, but after the atrocities she witnessed, something broke inside her. She decided that the Havenites stood against everything that the natural order of nature was, that they had caused the war, that they were the enemy.

This pushed her over the edge when she lost everything. Nothing Elowen could say would stop her as she took up the mantle of the Fanewraith, transforming from a gentle healer into a figure of shadow and death.

Over the following months, she built up a reputation as a skilled hunter, assassin, and link between the natural world and the spirit. Somehow, she had gained the ability to converse with spirits, a power that caught the eye of those in high command of Haven. They wished to hire her for a suicide mission: to steal the Reaping Eye of Nikta and return it to Haven for keeping, to kick off the events of the everlasting bloom.

Through her connections within Fanewick, she led the attack on Nikta at her weakest point, stealing the eye and disappearing, leaving Nikta to flee back to the Astral Realm and abandon the mortal world.

She slowly gained control over Alula through bribery, shadow tactics, and leverage. Anyone tied to her past was cut down—only Elowen remained. She had escaped a while back, but anyone using that name in Alula would be marked and not see the next sunrise.

Elowen didn't know currently who was loyal to the Fanewraith in the village. They must be careful who they spoke to. Her warning was poetic and chilling: "In the canopy, every branch has eyes. Trust the ones that do not look back."

---

## The Twisted Vine Tree

She said it may be too late to save Theodore. There was a lot of hidden force that didn't catch the eye. But they should look toward the twisted vine tree—that was where they usually kept the prisoners.

The withering effect was too strong, so Demetrius could not take them directly there, but he could take them near. It was a start, a path forward when time was running out.

Sabriel thought it better to attack the Fanewraith outside of Alula, a strategic consideration that might give them an advantage. Fern, ever thoughtful, gave Elowen some cake in thanks—a small gesture, but one that carried meaning between them.

As they prepared to leave, Elowen offered one more piece of information: Elara's control went right to the top of the council. Some had been turned and corrupted, but not all. There were still those who might help, if they could be found and trusted.

---

## The Path Forward

Back at the cottage, Demetrius began digging a tunnel to help the party get close to the twisted tree. The work would take time, but it was a path forward, a way to reach Theodore before the sun rose and the executions began.

The session ended there, with the party divided but connected, with truths revealed and dangers understood. They knew now who the Fanewraith was, what she had become, and how deeply her influence ran through Alula. They knew where to look for Theodore, and they knew that time was running out.

The twisted vine tree awaited them, and with it, answers and choices that would determine not just Theodore's fate, but their own. In the canopy, every branch had eyes, and trust was a currency they would have to spend carefully in the days ahead.
