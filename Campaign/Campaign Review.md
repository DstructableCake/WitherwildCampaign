# Campaign Review: Sessions 0-8

## Campaign Summary

The campaign follows a group of unlikely allies—**Sabriel** (a redeeming knight), **Snicket** (a goblin rogue), **Fern** (a fungril hedge witch), **Fianna** (a faun druid), and **Gnirth** (an amnesiac fungril sorcerer)—as they navigate the borderlands between the industrialized **Haven** and the wild, corrupted **Fanewick**.

### The Journey So Far

*   **Session 1: Attack on Stolen Fen**
    *   **Event:** The party converged at the settlement of Stolen Fen. A sudden attack by **Bloodwings** and their Queen forced them to fight together.
    *   **Key Intro:** They met **Captain Thorne** (Sabriel's contact) and **Delilah Goldtooth** (Snicket's contact).
    *   **Hook:** Fianna and Fern met Gnirth in the brush, sensing a disturbance in the Fungril network.

*   **Session 2: The Road Through Nightveil**
    *   **Event:** Travel to the **Barracks** and **Monks Eliegh**. They encountered a sick bear (Fianna's first brush with the specific corruption affecting beasts).
    *   **Key NPC:** Met **Valerius** (Drill Sergeant) at the Barracks and **Tybella** (a Fungril working in the kitchens).
    *   **Discovery:** Monks Eliegh is a town of people frozen in stone. **Mathias Vanta**, the priest, tends to them.

*   **Session 3: Ambush at the Weir**
    *   **Event:** Met **Kreil Durn** at the Old Weir. He revealed the core plot: The **Fanewraith** stole the **Reaping Eye** and plans to steal the **Sowing Eye** during the Rite of the Turning Gaze.
    *   **Conflict:** An ambush by **Inferni** assassins collapsed the Weir. The party escaped, but Kreil was injured.
    *   **Hook:** Kreil revealed **Fianna's father (Theodore)** had passed through, heading to **Alula** to hunt the Fanewraith.

*   **Session 4: The Assassin and the Communion**
    *   **Event:** Interrogated an assassin who committed suicide with a poisoned tooth. Fern attempted to commune with the spirit **Bolgin** but contacted a terrifying "Toad" entity instead ("I will return").
    *   **Key NPC:** Met **Fulg**, the Stacker of Stones, a faint divinity of balance.
    *   **Hook:** Tybella was contacted via the Fungril network but the connection felt insecure/watched.

*   **Session 5: The Hidden Market**
    *   **Event:** Traveled through **Nightveil** (perpetual twilight). Fianna freed corrupted animals from a hunter's camp.
    *   **Location:** Visited the **Low Passage Night Market**. Snicket picked up supplies and investigated Veil distribution corruption.

*   **Session 6 & 7: The Siege of Serpents Hope**
    *   **Event:** Arrived at **Serpents Hope** farms just as a coordinated assault began (Fireflies, Bloodwings, Moths).
    *   **Climax:** A massive **Leshen** (Corrupted Warden) emerged. The party defeated it, but the farms were ruined.
    *   **Reveal:** Sabriel received letters suggesting the Fanewraith might be **Elara Voss** (an old healer) and that the corruption is coordinated.
    *   **Gnirth's Memory:** Gnirth had a flashback to **Tideveil Enclave**, remembering a ritual involving black dust and a water elemental.

*   **Session 8 (Travel):**
    *   **Event:** Journey into the **Riverwalker Hunting Grounds**. Met **Silas Thornfoot** and **Elder Lyra**.
    *   **Discovery:** Found **Theodore's broken lute string** and a piece of **Brindle's antler** near Alula, implying a struggle/capture.

## Outstanding Story Hooks

### 1. The Eyes & The Rite
*   **Status:** **Active / Critical**
*   **Origin:** Session 3 (Kreil Durn).
*   **Details:** The **Reaping Eye** is gone. The **Sowing Eye** is the next target. The **Rite of the Turning Gaze** is the deadline/event where this will likely happen.
*   **Next Step:** Alula is the staging ground. The party needs to stop the theft or recover the stolen Eye.

### 2. Fianna’s Father (Theodore) & Brindle
*   **Status:** **Urgent / Rescue**
*   **Origin:** Session 3 (Kreil) & Session 8 (Clues).
*   **Details:** Theodore went to Alula to stop the Fanewraith. Clues (lute string, antler) suggest he and Brindle were attacked just outside the village.
*   **Current State:** Captured in Alula. Scheduled for execution (Session 9 Prep). Brindle's status is unknown but likely injured/captured.

### 3. The Identity of the Fanewraith
*   **Status:** **Unresolved / Twist Pending**
*   **Origin:** Session 3 (Kreil) & Session 7 (Letters).
*   **Details:**
    *   Kreil said it was a commoner.
    *   Valerius wrote it might be **Elara Voss**.
    *   **The Truth (Sabriel's Hook):** The "Commander" in Alula is likely **Evelyn DeVoss**, Sabriel's former commander, posing as or working for the Fanewraith.
*   **Next Step:** Confrontation in Alula (Session 9).

### 4. Snicket’s Package & The Serpent Coins
*   **Status:** **Active**
*   **Origin:** Session 1 (Delilah) & Session 3 (Assassin's Coin).
*   **Details:** Snicket is carrying a package for **Mr. Tilde** in Alula. She also found **Serpent Coins** on assassins, used as ID for the Fanewraith's network.
*   **Next Step:** Deliver the package to Mr. Tilde in Alula (Session 9) and use the coins to infiltrate.

### 5. Gnirth’s Past (Tideveil)
*   **Status:** **Simmering**
*   **Origin:** Session 2 (Water control) & Session 7 (Vision).
*   **Details:** Gnirth has amnesia. He recalled **Tideveil Enclave** and a ritual that "cleansed stagnation" but seemingly caused corruption. The black ooze responds to him.
*   **Next Step:** The river below Alula "remembers" him. Further clues likely lie in the ruins of Tideveil.

### 6. Fern’s Connection to the "Toad"
*   **Status:** **Dormant Threat**
*   **Origin:** Session 4 (Communion).
*   **Details:** Fern tried to reach Bolgin but touched a vast, tar-black entity (The Toad) that claimed "It has already been set in motion."
*   **Next Step:** This entity is likely the source or a major power behind the Witherwild corruption.

### 7. Tybella & The Fungril Network
*   **Status:** **Suspicious**
*   **Origin:** Session 2 (Barracks) & Session 4 (Call).
*   **Details:** Tybella is a Fungril working in Haven's barracks. The last call was "insecure." Is she a traitor, a prisoner, or a double agent?

## Core NPCs (Active & Needed)

### In Alula (Immediate Relevance)
*   **Evelyn DeVoss (The Commander):** The primary antagonist for this arc. Sabriel's foil. Cold, military precision.
*   **Theodore Underbrush:** Fianna's father. Currently a prisoner. Optimistic bard.
*   **Mr. Tilde:** Snicket's contact. Slyborne smuggler. Nervous but connected.
*   **Elowen:** The "Old Woman" encountered in the woods (Session 6). Revealed to be a helper/grandmother figure, not the villain.

### Allies & Quest Givers (Background)
*   **Kreil Durn:** The spymaster. Currently recovering (location unknown/safe house).
*   **Mathias Vanta:** Priest at Monks Eliegh. Guardian of the stone people.
*   **Valerius:** Drill Sergeant at the Barracks. Sabriel's ally.
*   **Fulg:** Stacker of Stones. Faint divinity messenger.

### Antagonists (Looming)
*   **The Fanewraith:** The figurehead of the rebellion/corruption.
*   **The Toad Entity:** The cosmic horror behind the scenes.

## Unconcluded Story Points / Loose Ends

*   **The Frozen People of Monks Eliegh:** Why are they frozen? Can they be saved? (Linked to the balance of the Eyes?)
*   **The "Sickness" Cure:** Hunters were capturing beasts to find a cure (Session 5). Is Haven making progress, or making it worse?
*   **The Serpent Coins:** Who is minting them? They imply a level of organization and resources (a forge) that rebels shouldn't have.
*   **Sabriel's "Unstoppable" Armor:** It cracked during the Leshen fight (Session 7). Needs repair or upgrade.
