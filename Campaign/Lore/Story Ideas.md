## A Plot: The Cycle's Reckoning

### **Core Goal:** 

- The party must reunite [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]'s Eyes ([[Reaping Eye]] in Haven's Vault, [[Sowing Eye]] hidden in her weft-form) to restore seasonal balance, ending the Witherwild and Sickness. 
- This culminates in a climactic choice: Return both Eyes to Nikta (true balance, but risks famine for Haven), destroy them (permanent imbalance, empowering a new threat like awakened Shun’Aush), or wield them (personal power, but corrupts the wielder). 
- The BBEG is a "duality"—Phylax (Haven's desperate innovator) and Fanewraith (Fanewick's vengeful radical)—who must be confronted/convinced/defeated in a final multi-faction summit or battle at God's Nest (levels 9-10). 
- Campaign ends when the Eyes are resolved, symbolizing themes of cultural clash, grief, and transformation.
  
### **Stakes:** 
- Escalating from personal (e.g., Fern's grove corrupts fully, Brindle dies) to global (Witherwild engulfs Haven/Fanewick, Sickness mutates into something worse). 
- Human cost: Villagers petrify mid-prayer (horror/suspense), corrupted beasts evoke whimsy-turned-terror (awe/darkness). 
- No villains—Phylax justifies as "saving the masses from elite hubris" (populism), Fanewraith as "nature's revenge on invaders" (class warfare). Failure means perpetual imbalance (eternal spring/winter famine).
  
### **Involved Parties:** 
- [[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]] (Haven BBEG half, desperate innovator), 
- [[Fanewraith]] (Fanewick BBEG half, vengeful leader), 
- [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]] (neutral force, tests party), 
- Elara (mediator, guides to weft), 
- [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]] (pragmatic ally/opportunist). 
- Party arcs tie in: 
	- [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] cleanses her grove, 
	- [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]] heals Brindle/saves Kin, 
	- [[Gnirth]] recalls origins, 
	- [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] atones, 
	- [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]] finds family/cure.

## B Plot: The Dustveil Conspiracy 

### **Core Goal:** 
- A shadowy conspiracy (led by a hidden third faction, e.g., a populist Haven defector group allied with Withered Covenant outcasts) spreads a "Dustveil" hybrid plague (Sickness + Witherwild, creating stone-plant hybrids). 
- It interferes by corrupting key locations/resources (e.g., veils turn toxic, groves petrify), forcing the party to deal with outbreaks regularly without fully resolving it until they choose (or it merges with A Plot). 
- The conspiracy's motive: "Equalize" suffering (populism—make elites feel the pain of the masses via engineered chaos).
### **Stakes:** 
- Frustrates A Plot by blocking progress (e.g., corrupted veils halt cures, petrified paths delay Eye hunts). 
- Human side: Conspirators are justified Sickness survivors seeking revenge on Haven's elite (class warfare), but their actions cause innocent grief (horror/consequences). 
- Escalates subtly: Early "nuisance" outbreaks (levels 1-4), mid-game blockades (5-7), late-game mergers with Witherwild (8-10). 
- If ignored, it could "win" by mutating Nikta herself.
### **Involved Parties:** 
- Anonymous leader (reveal as a Phylax defector or Wickling turncoat), 
- Withered Covenant zealots, opportunistic NPCs like Hale (kickbacks tie in). 
- Party arcs: 
	- Snicket's scars worsen, 
	- Gnirth's urges amplify, 
	- Fern's grove is targeted.

## Detailing the A Plot: The Cycle's Reckoning

### Core Beats (Levels 1-10 Escalation)

1. **Levels 1-3: Discovery and Awakening (Whimsical/Safe Start)**
    - **Instigation:** Kreil's invitation draws the party to Haven (or a border meet), revealing the [[Sowing Eye]] plot. A prologue vision (from Nikta or Elara) signposts the Eyes' importance and the party's role in balance.
    - **Actions/Events:** Party investigates early clues (e.g., corrupted site in Stolen Fen), meets Fanewraith (ambush/test), learns of Reaping Eye in Vault. Stakes low: Personal threats (e.g., Brindle attacks Fianna, Fern's grove whispers warnings).
    - **Involved Parties:** 
	    - Kreil (quest giver), 
	    - Fanewraith (antagonist intro), 
	    - Elara (vision guide). 
	    - Party arcs: 
		    - Fern sees beautiful corruption (e.g., glowing flower that heals but tokens), 
		    - Gnirth recalls a water-urge memory.
    - **Reveal Seed:** Artifact (e.g., shard of Reaping Eye facsimile) hints at Vault location; signpost choice: "Two Eyes, one balance—choose wisely."
    
- **Levels 4-6: Interference and Escalation (Suspense/Horror Build)**
    - **Instigation:** Party's actions draw attention—Fanewraith recruits (or attacks) if they oppose Haven, Phylax sends agents if they threaten the Vault.
    - **Actions/Events:** Quests to gather tools (e.g., weft-key from God's Nest, anti-Sickness tonic from Rot Hollow). Stakes rise: Witherwild mutates allies (e.g., Snicket's scars spread, Gnirth's urges cause a flood).
    - **Involved Parties:** Phylax (sends pursuers), Fanewraith (offers alliances/tests), Rook (hybrid guide). Party arcs: Fianna heals Brindle partially, Sabriel atones by saving Wicklings.
    - **Reveal Seed:** Elara reveals Sowing Eye's weft location; signpost: "Reunite or wield—power corrupts the holder."
    
- **Levels 7-8: Convergence and Crisis (Awe/Darkness Peak)**
    - **Instigation:** Party acquires a key item (e.g., weft-map), forcing a multi-faction summit at Silver Sage—Phylax and Fanewraith both attend (or send proxies), leading to betrayal/ambush.
    - **Actions/Events:** Infiltrate Vault or weft for one Eye; face dual BBEG forces. Stakes high: Populism erupts (Haven riots, Wickling uprisings), human cost shown (petrified villages, corrupted loved ones).
    - **Involved Parties:** Phylax/Fanewraith (clash), Kreil (mediator/betrayer), Quill (host). Party arcs: Gnirth regains memories (elemental origin tied to Nikta), Snicket finds family (corrupted in Fen).
    - **Reveal Seed:** Shun’Aush's spirit awakens, hinting at greater threat if Eyes aren't reunited; signpost final choice.
    
- **Levels 9-10: Reckoning and Resolution (Epic Climax)**
    - **Instigation:** Party holds both Eyes—Phylax/Fanewraith converge at God's Nest for final confrontation.
    - **Actions/Events:** Multi-phase battle/summit: Debate (social rolls), combat (BBEG duel), choice (reunite/destroy/wield). Stakes global: Imbalance risks total collapse (eternal famine or overgrowth).
    - **Involved Parties:** Phylax/Fanewraith (BBEG duality), Nikta (manifests to judge), Elara/Kreil (allies/turncoats). Party arcs: Full resolution (Fern's grove saved, Brindle healed, Gnirth's past revealed, Sabriel atones, Snicket cures scars/finds kin).
    - **Reveal Seed:** Final vision shows consequences of choice; campaign ends with balance restored (or new imbalance for sequel hook).

## Detailing the B Plot: The Dustveil Conspiracy

### Core Beats (Interfering Across Levels 1-10)

1. **Levels 1-3: Subtle Intrusions (Frustration Build)**
    - **Instigation:** Early C Plot disrupted by "mysterious outbreaks" (e.g., veils in Stolen Fen turn dusty, infecting workers with hybrid plague).
    - **Actions/Events:** Party cleanses minor sites, uncovers clues (e.g., propaganda notes: "Elites hoard cures—share the dust!"). Frustration: Outbreaks block travel/resources without clear source.
    - **Involved Parties:** Anonymous conspirators (revealed later as Haven defectors + Withered outcasts), opportunistic NPCs like Hale (ignores for quotas).
    - **Interference with A Plot:** Delays Eye hunts (e.g., corrupted path to God's Nest). Party arcs: Snicket's scars flare, Fern's grove shows hybrid signs.
    
2. **Levels 4-6: Escalating Interference (Suspense/Frustration Peak)**
    - **Instigation:** Conspiracy targets party directly (e.g., infects Brindle further, or Gnirth's urges amplify with "dust visions").
    - **Actions/Events:** Investigate outbreaks (e.g., petrified-plant hybrids in Rot Hollow); confront low-level agents spreading populism ("The poor suffer—make elites feel it!").
    - **Involved Parties:** Leader emerges (e.g., "Veilshade," a Sickness-scarred Haven peasant allied with Covenant). Frustration: Agents flee, propaganda sows doubt (e.g., "Haven's elite caused this—join us!").
    - **Interference with A Plot:** Corrupts key items (e.g., veils needed for Vault infiltration turn toxic). Party arcs: Sabriel questions Haven loyalty, Fianna sees "justified" corruption.
    
3. **Levels 7-8: Crisis and Optional Resolution (Horror/Choice Point)**
    - **Instigation:** Conspiracy merges with A Plot (e.g., infects a summit, turning attendees into hybrids).
    - **Actions/Events:** Party can pursue/ignore—hunt leader or let it fester. Frustration: If ignored, outbreaks escalate (e.g., hybrid plague hits party's hometowns).
    - **Involved Parties:** Veilshade (BBEG-lite, redeemable via debate), Covenant zealots. Justified: "We equalize pain—elites hoard, masses die!"
    - **Interference with A Plot:** Could mutate Nikta if unresolved, forcing hybrid "balance."
    
4. **Levels 9-10: Merger or Aftermath (If Unresolved)**
    - **Instigation:** If not dealt with, conspiracy aids BBEG (e.g., hybrids swarm God's Nest).
    - **Actions/Events:** Final interference or resolution during A Plot climax.
    - **Involved Parties:** As above; could ally with party if convinced (populism twist).
    - **Interference with A Plot:** Amplifies stakes (e.g., hybrid Sickness corrupts Eyes).
