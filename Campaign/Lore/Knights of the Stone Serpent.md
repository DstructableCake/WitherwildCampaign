### Overview

The Knights of the Stone Serpent are a religious-military order sworn to Haven's defense, drawing from [[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid|Shun'Aush]]'s deicide legacy. 

Founded to guard borders against Faint Divinities, they embody "godless faith" - human resilience over divine whim. 
Post-invasion, they're fractured: Many like Sabriel. regret the "necessary evil," while hardliners enforce occupation. Populism simmers - commoner knights resent highborne commanders who avoided frontlines/Sickness. 

Symbol: Coiled serpent on stone shield. 
Motto: **"From Serpent's Fall, We Rise."**

### History

- **Founding (Post-Deicide):** 
	- Formed from deicide survivors to protect Haven's "godless gate," focusing on anti-divine tactics (e.g., wards against Faint Divinities).
- **Pre-Invasion Era:** 
	- Patrolled Fanewick borders, handling skirmishes (e.g., Sabriel's bandit uprising, divinity lures). 
	- Viewed Wicklings as "weak" for divinity pacts.
- **Invasion Role (1 Year Ago):** 
	- Vanguard in bog seizure
	- Sabriel's unit "burned" Bolgin. 
	- Heavy losses bred regrets; 
	- Sickness decimated ranks (elites spared via quarantines).
- **Current Era (Post-Witherwild):** 
	- Divided - some atone by aiding Wicklings ([[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]), others enforce farms.

> [!NOTE]
> - **A Plot (Cycle's Reckoning):** Knights guard Vault (Reaping Eye); Sabriel's knowledge aids infiltration. Bolgin's "return" could rally/destroy them.
> - **B Plot (Dustveil Conspiracy):** Infiltrated by resentful commoners; outbreaks target their patrols (class warfare).
> - **Player Tie (Sabriel):** His order; quests could reform it (e.g., expose corruption). For others: Fianna sees them as "invader serpents"; Snicket smuggles to disgruntled knights.
