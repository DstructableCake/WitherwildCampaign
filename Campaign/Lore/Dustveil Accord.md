## Overall Summary

- **Core Concept:** A populist movement born from Sickness grief, blending Haven's underclass (resenting highborne hoarding) and Fanewick's Withered rejects (embracing corruption as "evolution for all"). They engineer "Dustveil" outbreaks—a hybrid plague fusing Sickness petrification with Witherwild overgrowth, creating stone-plant abominations. Their manifesto: "Equality in Dust"—force elites (Haven highborne, Wickling "collaborators") to suffer like the masses, exposing systemic failures (class warfare). Justified? Yes—leaders are survivors who watched loved ones ossify while elites like Phylax experimented safely. No black/white: Their chaos saves some (e.g., redistributing veils) but dooms innocents (horror/human cost).
  
- **Drive/Motivation:** Populism fueled by grief— "If the mighty won't share the cure, we'll share the curse." They believe true balance comes from universal suffering, eroding divides (Haven poor vs. elites, Wicklings vs. invaders). Not evil; they're "equalizers" in a broken world, with charismatic appeals that could sway NPCs/PCs (e.g., Sabriel's regrets or Snicket's scars).
  
- **Scale/Threat Level:** Small cells (10-20 members per outbreak), not an army—frustrating but not overwhelming. They avoid direct fights, focusing on hit-and-run chaos to sow doubt (e.g., propaganda blaming "elite hubris" for imbalance).
  
- **Tie to A Plot:** Interferes by corrupting Eye-related sites (e.g., petrifying weft portals, veiling Vault paths with dust-plants), forcing detours. If unresolved, merges in late game (e.g., hybrids swarm God's Nest during final reckoning).

## Leader 

- **Background/Origin:** [[Veilshade|Lira Thorne]] (she/her, ~35, human from Haven's slums) was a lowborn herbalist in a border district, blending Wickling remedies with Haven alchemy. Poverty-stricken, she watched her community petrify during the Sickness's peak—elites like highborne hoarded early veils while her siblings ossified mid-prayer (grief/human cost). She contracted Sickness but survived, awakening a latent "dustweaving" skill (manipulates Sickness dust into plant-like forms without tokens, discovered when dust-vines grew from her scars to save her). No relations to key figures—she's a self-made populist, rising from anonymity via fiery speeches in quarantined zones. Her mask (a veil of petrified leaves) hides her identity, symbolizing "dust for all."
  
- **Special Skill/Drive:** 
	- Dustweaving—innate ability (perhaps a Wither mutation or latent divine spark from Shun’Aush dust exposure) lets her create hybrid outbreaks (e.g., dust-infused vines that petrify on touch). 
	- Drive: Personal vendetta against inequality— "I lost everything to their greed; now they lose to our equality." 
	- Justified: Elites caused the Sickness (progress tilled deep, releasing dust); she spreads it to force reform (populism). 
	- Personality: Charismatic orator with quiet fury—whimsical in speeches ("Dust blooms for the forgotten!"), horrifying in action (commands hybrids with maternal care). 
	- Quirk: Weaves dust into flower shapes when agitated, whispering to them like lost siblings.
  
- **Motivations/Secrets:** 
	- Seeks "universal reckoning"—infect elites to topple Haven's hierarchy, then "evolve" Wicklings via Witherwild (transformation theme). 
	- Secrets: Her dustweaving slowly corrupts her (gains tokens privately, risking hybrid form); keeps a "equality ledger" of targeted elites (including Phylax); fears her skill stems from a forbidden pact with a minor divinity (e.g., a forgotten Shun’Aush fragment). 
	- Subplot: If unmasked, her "commoner" origin humanizes her—PCs might negotiate (e.g., via Sabriel's atonement) or radicalize her further.
  
- **Role in Story:** Charismatic figurehead (Amon-like), but not always present—leads via masked broadcasts (whisper-vines carrying speeches). Appears mid-B Plot for debates, not fights, emphasizing justified chaos.

## Organisation

- **Structure/Size:** Loose, decentralized cells (5-15 members each) of Haven slum-dwellers (defectors disillusioned with elites) and Withered Wicklings (outcasts embracing mutation as "equality"). No rigid hierarchy—Veilshade inspires via propaganda, with local "Bloomers" (cell leaders) handling ops. Total: 50-100 across borders, growing via recruitment (populist rallies in quarantined zones).
  
- **Drive/Goals:** Class warfare—"Dust for the mighty, veils for the meek." Short-term: Sabotage elite resources (e.g., corrupt veils, petrify highborne estates). Long-term: Collapse divides (force Haven withdrawal by making occupation unsustainable, "evolve" Wicklings to resist). Justified: Members are victims (e.g., a farmer whose family petrified while elites feasted)—actions "redistribute pain" (human side/darkness).
  
- **Internal Dynamics:** Mix of idealism (whimsical "bloom parties" where hybrids dance) and horror (members risk self-infection). Fractures possible—some want reform, others total chaos (sow doubt for players).

## Tactics and Interference

- **Tactics:** Subtle, asymmetrical—hit-and-run sabotage (e.g., dust-bombs in farms turning veils toxic), propaganda (notes/graffiti: "Elites hoard—share the dust!"), recruitment (charismatic speeches in slums, appealing to grief). Avoid direct fights; use hybrids as distractions (horror/suspense). Masked anonymity makes them hard to pin (mysterious/alooof).
  
- **How They Interfere (Frustration Without Dominance):** Pop up unpredictably to block A Plot progress (e.g., petrify a weft portal, forcing detour; infect a key NPC like Elara, delaying rituals). Frustrating because: Outbreaks are "random" (tied to PC actions, like visiting a farm), propaganda sows doubt (e.g., "Is Phylax the real villain?"), and they're resolvable piecemeal (cleanse one site, but another pops up). Not spotlight-stealing: Limit to 1-2 interruptions per 3 sessions; make them quick (1 encounter + investigation); tie to C Plots (e.g., outbreak during a hunt). If players ignore, escalate subtly (e.g., hybrid blocks a path but flees).
  
- **GM Tips to Balance:** Keep encounters short/non-lethal (focus on puzzles/social rolls over combat). Use as "complication" (e.g., +1 encounter difficulty), not main event. Resolution optional— if players hunt Veilshade early, B Plot ends (shortens interference); if not, it merges with A (hybrids at final battle).


## Placement in World 

- **World Position:** Operates in border zones (Stolen Fen, Dreary Way, Rot Hollow)—Haven slums for recruitment, Fanewick wilds for Withered allies. Not a "base" faction; cells hide in quarantined ruins or corrupted groves (ties to Fern's backstory). Symbol: A veiled serpent entwined with thorns (populism icon).
  
- **Story Role:** B Plot interferes with A by amplifying imbalance (e.g., Dustveil hybrids corrupt Eye sites, forcing party to choose: cleanse (delay A) or push on (risk tokens)). Escalation: Early (subtle outbreaks), Mid (target party, e.g., infect Brindle), Late (merge: hybrids aid Phylax/Fanewraith if unresolved). Humanizes tones: Conspirators are "everyman" victims (e.g., a petrified farmer's widow joins for revenge), showing justified chaos without villainy.
  
- **Ties to A Plot:** Dustveil outbreaks "test" party choices (e.g., save elites or masses?), mirroring A’s duality. Veilshade could be a wildcard ally (if convinced populism aligns with balance) or final minion.

## Seeds 

- **Hooks/Reveals:** 
	- Start with minor interference (e.g., Dustveil note in Stolen Fen: "Elites caused this—join the reckoning!"). 
	- Reveals: Unmask agents mid-game (social rolls expose backstories), leading to Veilshade confrontation (debate/combat). 
	- Party arcs: Snicket's scars worsen (personal stake), Gnirth's urges amplify (elemental chaos), Fern's grove targeted (corruption mirror), Fianna sees "justified" vengeance (Kin tie), Sabriel questions Haven elitism (atonement crisis).
  
- **Resolution Options:** 
	- Redeem (convince [[Veilshade]] via Presence rolls/populist debate—joins A Plot ally); 
	- Defeat (kill/capture, ending B early); 
	- Ignore (merges with A, escalating finale with hybrids). 
	- Avoid spotlight: Limit to 10-15% session time; use as "complication" in C Plots.
