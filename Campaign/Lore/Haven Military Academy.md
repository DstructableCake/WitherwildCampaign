### Overview

The Haven Military Academy is Haven's premier training ground for warriors, wizards, and officers, located within the god-corpse walls of the capital. 
Founded centuries ago after [[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid|Shun'Aush]]'s deicide, it embodies Haven's "godless" ethos - focusing on human ingenuity over divine reliance. Amid the [[Serpents Sickness]], it has become a symbol of populism and division: Elites dominate leadership, while commoners grind through ranks, fueling resentment. 

The Academy trains for border defense and invasions, but post-Witherwild, curricula include "corruption containment" (anti-Wither tactics). 

Motto: **"From Stone, Strength"**

### History

- **Founding (Centuries Ago):** 
	- Established after [[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid|Shun'Aush]]'s slaying to train "godless guardians" against Faint Divinities. 
	- Early focus: Anti-divine wards and tactics
- **Pre-Invasion Era:** 
	- Grew into a merit-based institution, but highborne influence created class divides—commoners like Sabriel entered via church connections, facing elite favoritism.
- **Invasion Role (1 Year Ago):** 
	- Served as vanguard hub for Fanewick assault
	- Sabriel's unit ([[Knights of the Stone Serpent]]) secured bogs. 
	- Losses were high, exacerbating Sickness resentment (elites quarantined safely while recruits died).
- **Current Era (Post-Witherwild):** 
	- [[Serpents Sickness]] halved enrollment
	- Populism brews (commoner cadets whisper of elite hoarding cures). 
	- DM
	- %%[[Dustveil]] infiltrates via disgruntled dropouts, spreading hybrid outbreaks in barracks.%%

### Structure and Training

- **Districts/Buildings:**
    - **Stoneheart Hall (Main Academy):** Elite officer training; highborne-dominated, with arcane labs for ward innovation ([[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]]'s influence).
    - **Serpent Barracks (Recruit Quarters):** Commoner housing; rigorous drills in anti-divine combat and Sickness protocols (e.g., dust-masks, quarantine drills).
    - **Bog Simulation Grounds:** Outdoor arena mimicking Fanewick bogs; trains Wither containment (vine-burning, hybrid combat) - site of Sabriel's pre-invasion drills.
- **Training Focus:** 
	- Blade/Arcana Domains emphasized
	- Commoners endure harsher conditions, breeding loyalty to orders like Stone Serpent.
- **Key Traditions:** 
	- Annual "Dust Vigil" (simulate Sickness outbreaks)
	- "Godless Oath" (forsake divinities, echoing Haven's ethos).

### Ties to Campaign
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - **A Plot (Cycle's Reckoning):** Academy wards protect Reaping Eye; could be infiltration point (Sabriel's knowledge key).
> - **B Plot (Dustveil Conspiracy):** Outbreaks target "elite" cadets, sowing chaos—Veilshade recruits dropouts.
> - **Player Tie (Sabriel):** His alma mater; quests could return here for atonement (e.g., expose corruption). For others: Snicket smuggles contraband to cadets; Fern/Thring see it as "stone oppression."
