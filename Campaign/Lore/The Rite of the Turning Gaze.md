This sacred rite marks the transition between the seasons of Reaping and Sowing, honouring the dual nature of [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]], the deity of cycles.

### The Night of The Seeing

**Occasion:** The eve of the transition from Reaping to Sowing.
**Purpose:** To commune with Nikta in Her fullest aspect, to offer gratitude for survival through the Reaping, and to embrace the promise of the Sowing.

**Observance:**

- **Vigil:** As the sun descends below the horizon, marking the end of the Reaping, the Kin gather at Nikta's holy temple.
- **Abstinence:** From sunset onwards, all Kin shall abstain from solid food, consuming only pure water, signifying purification and readiness to receive Nikta's full presence.
- **The Opening:** At the moment when Nikta's Reaping Eye, weary from the season of hardship, begins its closure, Her Sowing Eye simultaneously begins to open. For this singular night, both eyes are open, a sacred union allowing Nikta to See all.
- **Offerings:** The Kin present their most precious offerings at the altar, tokens of their devotion and remembrance.
- **Supplications:** Prayers are offered, and wishes are whispered into the presence of the fully-seeing Nikta.
- **Blessings of the Young:**
    - Babies born since the previous Night of The Seeing are brought forth to receive Nikta's protective blessing.
    - Those who have reached their majority present themselves to make their solemn vows of fealty and service to Nikta.
- **Communion:** This night is a celebration of Nikta's very essence and a collective reinforcement of faith, looking towards the prosperity promised by the coming Sowing months.

**The Closing:** With the dawn, Nikta's [[Reaping Eye]] gracefully closes, and the season of Sowing commences, guided by the watchful gaze of Her Sowing Eye.

### The Night of The Unseeing

**Occasion:** The eve of the transition from Sowing to Reaping.
**Purpose:** To express profound gratitude for the bounties of the Sowing season and to prepare the Kin for the coming trials of the Reaping.

**Observance:**

- **Gathering:** As the last light of the Sowing season fades, the Kin convene at the Temple, bringing forth the abundant fruits of Nikta's generosity.
- **The Closing:** As Nikta's Sowing Eye grows weary and prepares for its rest, it begins its closure. For this singular night, both of Nikta's eyes are closed, signifying a period of well-deserved repose.
- **Sharing the Bounty:** The Kin partake in a communal feast, sharing the gathered harvests. Large vessels of wine are prepared and shared amongst all present, a final celebration of summer's abundance.
- **Gratitude and Fortification:** This night is dedicated to heartfelt gratitude for the prosperity bestowed by Nikta and to fortifying the spirit and body in preparation for the challenges of the Reaping months ahead.

**The Opening:** With the first light of day, Nikta's [[Sowing Eye]] closes fully, and the season of Reaping begins, with the Kin fortified by gratitude and communal strength.

### [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]] Notes

The Night of the Unseeing. A night meant for rest and gratitude, a final feast before the lean months. Nikta’s Sowing Eye, like the sun at Summer's end, began its slow descent into closure. For this one night, She rested, Her vision withdrawn, allowing us a moment of profound peace after the season's bounty. We gathered at the Temple, the harvest abundant, the wine flowing freely. It was a night of shared joy, of thanks for the blessings Nikta had poured upon us, and a fortifying of our spirits for the coming Reaping.

But this year, the peace was shattered. The [[Havenites]] struck. It was a brutal, unexpected onslaught. With Nikta’s vision dimmed, and many of us, perhaps, too deep in the revelry, we were caught vulnerable. I saw them pour in, a tide of malice. We fought, of course, as best we could, but we were a generation caught unprepared, still savouring the fruits of peace.

The Temple, usually a sanctuary, became a battlefield. The air filled with the clash of steel and the cries of the fallen. Many good Kin perished, their lives extinguished in the blink of an eye. And Nikta… in Her deep rest, She was unaware until it was too late. They didn't just attack us; they attacked Her. I watched, helpless, as they breached Her sacred eyelid, as they tore out Her Reaping Eye. The pain that rippled through me, through all of us, was unspeakable.

How did they know? The Unseeing, our most private night of reflection and communion, had always been a secret held within the Kin. No outsider should have known of its timing, of its significance, of our vulnerability. Someone among us, someone we trusted, must have betrayed us. Or perhaps, an outsider had been watching, a spy lurking in the shadows, waiting for this precise moment. The very thought chills me to the bone. The sanctity of the night, defiled. The trust of our people, broken. The scars of this night, both on Nikta and on our hearts, will remain.
