The day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night.

During the long days, business and trade continue as normal.

But this cycle doesn’t just affect [[Wicklings]], it’s dictated how [[Fanewick]]’s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes. Those with sense still replicate the normal cycle by sleeping when it would be natural to, in darkened rooms blotting out the sun. 

Animals and other creatures will also try to replicate bot not to the same success. Predators used to hunting in the night have trouble during the week of sun, often being found weak and wearing by the end of the week if they cannot catch their prey.
Those that were preyed on alternatively have found abundance in the combination of lack of hunters ability to ambush, combined with the increase in forestry.

The plants similarly live on this strange day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a week. 

Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of forest—a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.
