The plague sweeping across [[Haven]] spares no one. Since
the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to
quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this
effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of
[[Lady's Veil|Crimson Lady's Veil]], many citizens began to carry or consume
all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to
protect or cure themselves.

In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough
laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled
rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique
and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long
after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and
cease to function. The final stages of the [[Serpents Sickness]] is
so quick that many transform into statues where they stand,
leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.
