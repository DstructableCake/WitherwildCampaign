Adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain
an additional type called Withered. When an adversary is
Withered, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted
how they would normally appear or operate. You also need
about 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens
you use for Fear).

Any time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered
adversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it
on that PC’s character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll
their Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of
Wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and
clear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them
permanently.

At the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the
PCs’ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character
ever dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is
permanently taken over by the Witherwild.
