# Inciting Incident
## Original

The Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the central tower of Haven’s wizarding school, seemingly impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group, led by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith (she/her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term consequences are not being considered, just as they weren’t when Haven invaded.

Haven’s beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to
start, and keeping a close watch on Haven’s internal activities. Kreil has never agreed—at least not openly—with Archmage Phylax’s (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and the consequences they’ve all paid for that decision have been grimly vindicating.

Recently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraith’s plot and is horrified by the possibility of her success. Knowing he can’t send a troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.

The party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the “enemy” they pursue. And what will they do when they find the Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to recover the Reaping Eye?

Kreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith in the treetop village of [[Alula]], where he suspects she runs her operation.

## Updated Hook

"In the shadowed bogs of Fanewick, where the week-long sun finally dips toward its seven-day slumber, whispers spread like creeping vines. The Witherwild stirs—trees twist into predatory shapes, their branches snapping like jaws, and beasts swollen by endless spring howl in the fading light. You've each felt its touch: a loved one lost to the overgrowth, a home strangled by thorns, or the dusty cough of Serpent's Sickness echoing from Haven's stone walls.

But now, a summons arrives, carried by a cloaked messenger who smells of burnt sugar and decay—the scent of night bloom flowers, blooming only in the long dark. It's an invitation from Kreil Dirn, Haven's spymaster, sealed with the emblem of the Godless Gate: a serpent's skull cracked by a blooming flower. He requests a meeting at the edge of the conquered bogs, in a neutral outpost called Thornwatch—a rickety wooden tower built by [[Wicklings]] ridgeborne scouts, now occupied by Haven orderborne guards. There, under the watchful eyes of Faint Divinities like Rohkin the Wandering Horn (who guards the herds twisted by the Witherwild), Kreil promises information that could end the corruption... or ignite a greater war.

Kreil claims to have uncovered a plot by the Fanewraith, a shadowy Wickling rebel (rumored to be a wildborne druid or slyborne insurgent, her form half-melded with thorny vines from Witherwild exposure). She plans to track down the Great Owl Nikta—now blinded in one eye and raging in the deep woods—and pluck out her remaining Sowing Eye to force an eternal winter, starving the Witherwild but dooming both Fanewick and Haven to famine. Kreil can't send his own troops without sparking open rebellion, so he seeks 'unaffiliated' heroes like you. But trust is scarce: Is this a trap to root out Fanewick sympathizers? Or a genuine plea from a man haunted by his city's plague statues?

Your journey begins in Alula, the treetop village perched in ancient canopy, where vines of sun rose climb during the day-week and wilt at night. But beware—the path is fraught with Withered beasts, and the Faint Divinity Hyacynis (They Who Spread Small Blossoms) has embraced the overgrowth, offering boons to those who aid the wild... or curses to invaders."

## New Hook

"The eternal spring of Fanewick has turned from blessing to curse. The Witherwild creeps like a living shadow, twisting beasts into monsters and vines into stranglers. In Haven, the Serpent's Sickness petrifies the living into stone statues, a grim reminder of Shun’Aush's ancient vengeance. The Reaping Eye, stolen from Nikta the Great Owl, lies locked in Haven's vaults—yet whispers of rebellion stir the winds.

You each receive a cryptic summons, delivered by a shadowy messenger who vanishes like mist. It's from Kreil Dirn, Haven's spymaster, sealed with the Godless Gate's serpent emblem. He invites you to a clandestine meeting at Thornwatch Outpost, a rickety tower on the Fanewick-Haven border, now a tense neutral ground guarded by wary Wickling scouts and Haven soldiers.

Kreil reveals he's uncovered a plot by the Fanewraith—a enigmatic Wickling rebel (rumored to be a wildborne druid or slyborne insurgent, her form veiled in thorny shadows). She aims to pluck Nikta's remaining Sowing Eye, plunging Fanewick into eternal winter to starve the Witherwild... at the cost of famine for all. Desperate, Kreil can't send Haven troops without igniting full war, so he seeks 'outsiders' like you.

But trust is fragile: Sabriel, your Order of the Stone Serpent once guarded these borders and led the invasion—does Kreil know your regrets, or is this a trap to expose disloyal knights? [Druid's name], your wanderings hide experiments to grow crimson lady's veil—could Kreil's spies have uncovered your secret, seeing it as a threat to Haven's farms? [Rogue's name], syndicates whisper of Fanewraith alliances— is this summons a recruitment or a betrayal? [Witch's name], lunar visions hint at divine unrest—does Kreil's plea align with the stars, or defy them?

Kreil urges you to begin in Alula, the treetop village where Fanewraith schemes. But whose side are you on? Restore balance by retrieving the Reaping Eye? Aid the Fanewraith's desperate gambit? Or forge a new path amid the overgrowth?"

# Ties to Communities

- [[Fanewick]]-focused players ([[Communities/Ridgeborne]], [[Communities/Underborne]], [[Communities/Wildborne]]) could receive the summons via a family tribute to a Faint Divinity (e.g., a stacked stone from [[Fulg, Stacker of Stones]], Stacker of Stones, whispers a warning). This personalizes it—ask in Session 0: "What tribute did your community offer that drew Kreil's attention?"
- The Syndicate Rogue (possibly [[Communities/Slyborne]]) might be approached as a "neutral informant" with ties to rebel groups, creating internal conflict if they're from Fanewick.
- The Guardian ([[Communities/Orderborne]], perhaps a Vengeance Guardian) could be "reassigned" by Kreil as a border protector who witnessed the invasion's horrors, adding regret (e.g., "What regrets do you carry from the conquest?").

# Ancestries and Classes

- If anyone plays [[Ancestries/Fungril]], [[Ancestries/Firbolg]], or [[Ancestries/Drakona]], describe their horns/fungi growing unnaturally en route, hinting at [[WitherWild]] corruption (mechanic intro: gain a Wither token for flavor, without high stakes).
- Syndicate Rogue: Kreil might offer them a covert role, tying into subclass themes of spying on Fanewick communities.
- Guardian: Position them as the "[[Haven]] liaison," grappling with themes of grief (lost comrades to Serpent's Sickness) and transformation.
# Ties to Distrinctions/ Mechanics

- Week of Day/Night: Time the meeting during the shift to night-week, when nocturnal beasts emerge—foreshadow low-stakes encounters (e.g., navigating bioluminescent night blooms guided by [[Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom]], the Watcher).
- Witherwild/Serpent's Sickness: Kreil coughs dust during the meeting (early stage sickness), showing vulnerability. Introduce Wither tokens narratively (e.g., a minor scratch from a vine gives 1 token, roll Fear Die to practice).
- Faint Divinities: Involve 1-2 gods in the scene—e.g., [[Ikla, the Sky Painter]] the Sky Painter lazily "paints" a dramatic sunset, offering a boon (minor miracle) if players pay tribute, teaching non-violent problem-solving.
- Lady's Veil: The outpost is surrounded by white flower fields, with rare crimson ones guarded—hint at a side quest to harvest one for a sick NPC.
# Flavour Details for Immersion

- Sensory: Sickly sweet flower smells mix with bog rot; distant howls of [[Withered]] animals; statues of petrified Haven soldiers line the path.
- Moral Depth: Kreil isn't a mustache-twirler—reveal he lost a child to the plague, humanizing Haven's desperation.
- Map Links: Start in Alula (treetop village, wildborne haven), branch to bogs (underborne displaced), forests (druid/ranger territory), and Haven's walls (highborne/ orderborne).

# Potential Mission Hooks

## Low-Stakes Intro Session: "Shadows in the Canopy" (Tutorial, Non-Combat Focus, 1-2 Hours)

- Hook: Before/after meeting Kreil, the party arrives in Alula during day-week's end. A minor Witherwild outbreak—twisting vines blocking a bridge—threatens a wickling family (ridgeborne NPCs). No real danger; it's a sandbox to experiment.
- Flavor/World Links: Involve Hyacynis offering a riddle for aid (tribute: share knowledge, tying to loreborne). Show beautiful Witherwild (glowing flowers) vs. terror (strangling vines).
- Mechanics Intro: Practice action rolls (e.g., Agility to climb vines), hope/fear (gain hope for creative non-violence, fear for failures), domain cards (use Evasion or Arcana to "commune" with plants). Low stakes: Failure adds 1 Wither token (cleared easily), teaching scars without death. End with a quiet moment for vulnerability (share backstories).
- Non-Combat Options: Negotiate with vines (via druid/ranger magic) or trade knowledge for safe passage.
- Tie to Group: Fanewick players protect "home"; rogue scouts hidden paths; Guardian enforces "order" non-violently.
## "Whispers from the Bog Farms" (Exploration/Social, Optional Combat)

- Hook: En route to Alula, investigate Haven's flower fields (bog-turned-farms). Displaced ribbet/galapa families (seaborne/underborne) beg for help retrieving a stolen crimson lady's veil needed for a sick child.
- Flavor/World Links: Sickly sweet smells; Withered animals lurk; tie to Serpent's Sickness (NPC coughs dust).
- Mechanics: Social rolls to negotiate with Haven guards; minor combat if vines attack (practice initiative/stress). Gain Wither tokens for flavor.
- Non-Combat: Stealth (rogue lead) or diplomacy (Guardian uses border authority).

## "Tribute to the Wandering Horn" (Puzzle/Roleplay, Low Combat)

- Hook: Rohkin demands tribute to reveal Fanewraith clues—track a Withered herd and "balance" it by saving a calf without killing.
- Flavor/World Links: Night-week beasts; horns growing on ancestries as omen.
- Mechanics: Fear Die rolls for corruption; hope for compassionate choices.

## "Spies in the Treetops" (Intrigue/Stealth, Optional Combat)

- **Hook:** In Alula, uncover a Haven spy (syndicate rogue-like) spreading rumors (orderborne tactic). Decide: expose, recruit, or use for info on Kreil/Fanewraith.
- **Flavor/World Links:** Treetop village with sun rose vines; ties to slyborne rebels.
- **Mechanics:** Practice evasion/combat if it escalates; build connections.

## "The Painter's Lazy Bargain" (Whimsical/Exploration, Combat Possible)

- Hook: Ikla refuses to "paint" a safe dawn unless players fetch rare pigments from Withered woods—encounter corrupted beasts or negotiate with Qui'Gar.
- Flavor/World Links: Scintillating skies; Faint Divinities' personalities.
- Mechanics: Environmental hazards (Wither tokens); reward with boons.
