These small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout
[[Fanewick]]. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled
flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers
have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the
crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even
so, they were only foraged until the [[Havenites]] discovered
crimson lady’s veil—the only known cure for [[Serpents Sickness]].

Thus, the [[Haven#Haven Army|Haven Army]] invaded Fanewick and began cultivating
the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s
bogs. Though the theft of the [[Reaping Eye]] has created an
indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare,
and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the
Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpent’s
Sickness.
