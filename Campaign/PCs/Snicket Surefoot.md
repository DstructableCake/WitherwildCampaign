## Playing Snicket

## History/Info

A small pale blue skinned goblin, with purple hair and skinny limbs. The tips of her wide ears have turned to stone where she caught the serpent sickness (since cured). Her ears are pierced with rings and chains running between them. She dresses in black, with a bandana around the neck to keep Haven's dust out of her mouth and a hooded jacket to hide herself at night. She has strips of material binding her shirt sleeves and trousers at the cuffs to minimise dust. 

Presumed orphaned at the age of 5. Raised by elderly neighbour that was initially babysitting Snicket overnight, but parents never came back. Stayed with neighbour until she died when Snicket was 10. From there, left to fend for herself and grow up as a street urchin. 

She found she had a talent for shadow magic and concealing herself. Used magic for some petty thievery until she was spotted by an orc shopkeeper, [[Samson Goldtooth]], who took her on as an apprentice. 

[[Samson Goldtooth|Samson]] ran a smuggling ring - booze, tobacco, weapons, rare herbs, etc - alongside the shop. 

When the serpent sickness started appearing, Samson was an early casualty, and is a statue in the shop as a permanent reminder. Once it became available, Snicket started smuggling red flower potion through the shop to help her friends and others with coin. 

Snicket recieves a note that she has living relatives in Fanewick and decides to pursue it under the cover of checking on her supply network.
