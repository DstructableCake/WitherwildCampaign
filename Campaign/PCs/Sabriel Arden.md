## Playing [[Bill]]

## History/Info

- Human Knight. Sabriel is in his late thirties. He grew up the son of a blacksmith, after his basic schooling at church it was this connection that got him into [[Haven Military Academy]]. He was an average recruit, but his determination saw steady progress. Once he graduated he joined the [[Knights of the Stone Serpent]]. A religious order of knights charged with keeping the peace on Havens border with Fanewick. Notable skirmishes were against a bandit uprising, and rescuing children who had been lured into [[Fanewick]] by a faint divinity.
- His home town has totally fallen to serpents sickness while he was on tour. When the disease was entering its final moments victims would go to church and pray. The town is deserted and the chapel full of statues.
- The priest [[Mathias Vanta]] has been spared, he stays in the church praying for the victims, Sabriel stops by once a month with supplies.
- The battle against [[Bolgin, Bringer of the Black Marsh]] was a D Day level event. He assumes he is the last of his unit still alive.
- When not attending to Mathias he is helping a village in fanewick as a lumberjack/farmhand/guard. Keeping the trees and bushes away from the village walls to improve safety and helping on farms as it's too dangerous to forage/hunt.

- Sabriel was a part of the original invasion as part of the vanguard to secure the bogs for plantations, taking part as a necessary evil. Half of Haven gone in the first wave, secure the cure or die.
- One of many abandoned towns. I thought a lot of the frontier towns on a haven map have a red snake stamped over them to signal they were lost to the illness. Thats where he goes to see Mathias.
- Before the war, he viewed the [[Wicklings]] as an odd neighbour. During the war an obstacle to saving his home. After the war a people to make up to.
- Before there was a looking down on the [[Wicklings]] as being too weak to take control of their environment. After the carnage in fighting off [[Bolgin, Bringer of the Black Marsh|Bolgin]] he understands a bit better as to why they would choose to work alongside the faint divinities instead of dominating them.
