## Playing [[Sara]]


## History/Info

My family is the high priestesses of the magic users called [[The Collective]]. There are links through Fungril networks to other magic users from other clans and villages. 
Family uses moon witchcraft. My spawning was delayed for some unknown reason- maybe because of the gods unknowable plan so I was spawned during an eclipse instead of a full moon and I have obtained the magic of hedge witchcraft instead-able to commune with the deceased and tread the vale between worlds. We started to notice an imbalance of the natural world, the grove started to decay and twisted vines started to grow. I set out to try to figure out the cause and how to stop the spread. While travelling I get word of a summon to the havenite Capitol initially refuse but after coming back home, I  see my village has been taken over by the corruption and agree to go and see what they can offer to help my village and bring balance back to nature 


## What They Want

1. ⁠I set out from my home to try to figure out what has happened and bring balance back to fanewick. 
2. I use animal bones to help commune with the hedge worlds and to help figure out how to proceed when needed. 
3. After seeing the corruption brought about by the havenites and the desecration of the balance of nature, the attempted destruction of the work of my gods, I return home and see that the corruption has spread to my village and corrupted everything I loved. 
4. ⁠I will stop at nothing to remove the corruption, save my village and bring balance back to the land, even if havenites get in my way.

## What They Know

We view the havenites as disruptors of the natural world as they have forsaken nature and how to coexist and worship the gods.

## Relations

1.⁠ ⁠[[Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom]] the watcher of the night bloom (because we are from a bioluminescent mushroom grove) we have passed down some knowledge of how to survive some parts of the night cycle. His influence is strongest during a full moon which makes full moons more dangerous
2.⁠ ⁠[[Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End]]whispered sweetness for a thorny end. The corruption has meant a lack of balance of nature which has made her job a lot more difficult. The gods are siblings 
3.⁠ ⁠⁠our species is born from spores from our birth givers- female only society
Mother- [[Drangea]] (Drea) Wingsteria- high priestess in community
-younger sibling twins- [[Amaryllis]] (Ammie) and [[Aster]] Wingsteria
