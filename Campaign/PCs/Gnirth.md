![[Gnirth Portait.png|400]]

## Playing [[Joey]]

Gnirth is a tormented seeker - voice deep and rumbling, like water churning over hidden depths, with occasional bursts of chaotic fervor. 
Roleplay him as introspective yet driven by uncontrollable urges, speaking in fragmented sentences when the "void" stirs.

Stand out: Pale fungal skin with watery veins pulsing faintly (elemental taint), eyes that swirl like storm-tossed pools when urges rise.

In scenes, he's brooding and ritualistic, twisting water or corpses instinctively - perfect for horror-tinged moments (e.g., "The void demands... renewal"). Voice line: "Water remembers what I cannot - let it flow, or drown in the dark." Use to build suspense: During calm RP, an urge might trigger a minor flood or corpse animation, forcing party intervention.

## History/Info

I have been wondering the world for a time now, seeking answers to why I cannot remember where I am from or who I truly am... I am compelled by my instincts and compulsions, using the network to commune with other Fungril-kin but to no true avail. I feel my connection is warped somehow and I only find myself chasing shadows or having to kill those who stand in my way of answers. When I seek to take memories from those recently given over the other world it only darkens my view.

When dealing with the deceased I am compelled to twist, through use of my power over water, to manipulate the corpses in set ways to appease a void or darkness within myself. The only true joy I gain is feeling the elemental rush surge through me when I take control of the elemental forces of water.

> [!NOTE] Additional History - Notes
> - Thring hails from the Tideveil Enclave, a remote, ritualistic Fungril clan in Fanewick's eastern bogs (near Rot Hollow). 
> - The clan worshiped elemental chaos as the "true order," disrupting balance to force renewal (contrasting Nikta's cycles). As a hardline acolyte, Thring led destructive water rituals (e.g., flooding "stagnant" lands). 
> - The cataclysm (1-2 years ago, tied to Eye theft's imbalance) was a failed ritual fusing Sickness dust with a water elemental—causing a petrifying flood that killed/drowned clan members and warped Thring's mind/network. 
> - He awoke amnesiac, his urges a corrupted echo of chaos worship. The Sickness taint blocks his network (tingles distort into painful static), and his corpse-twisting appeases the "void" (a parasitic chaos remnant). 
> - Secrets: The cataclysm accidentally amplified early Witherwild (dust + overgrowth = hybrids); Thring unknowingly caused a small outbreak by smuggling dust (populism: Targeted "stagnant elites" like Haven patrols). 
> - Plot hook: A network "glitch" with Fern draws him to a bog ruin, triggering a flashback.

Appearance: Pale fungal skin with watery veins; eyes swirl like storm pools during urges; simple traveler's robes stained with bog mud and faint dust traces.

Personality: Introspective and driven, with chaotic bursts; motivated by self-discovery but haunted by the void. Quirk: Twists water in his hands when anxious, forming brief, swirling shapes that hint at forgotten rituals.

## What They Want

- Regain lost memories/identity
- Discover true "elemental order" message (urges as corrupted chaos)
- Satisfy inner void without needless killing
- Fix warped [[Fungril]] network (Sickness cause).

## What They Know

We must satisfy the elemental urges and anyone who appears to defile or go against the natural orders must be killed and their bodies left for everyone else to see the consequences of doing so.

> [!NOTE]  Expanded DM Notes:
>- Thring's knowledge is fragmented and instinctual, focused on elemental chaos as "renewal" (e.g., flooding to cleanse stagnation). 
>- He knows water can "dilute" corruption (e.g., wash away Sickness dust or temper Witherwild vines), but his warped network distorts Fungril lore (e.g., messages arrive as chaotic riddles). 
>- He senses "voids" in others (e.g., corrupted areas or people like Fianna's Brindle), viewing them as "unrenewed." (GM Tip: Use for revelations—e.g., Instinct roll to "sense" a hidden hybrid, but failure triggers an urge.)

## Relations

[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] - Connected on network but not met before now.
%%
> [!NOTE] Title
> - **[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]]:** Pre-game network link (warped tingles shared eclipse visions); potential ally for reweaving signals, but his chaos urges clash with her balance-seeking hedge magic.
> - **[[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]]:** No prior meeting, but senses Brindle's taint as "chaotic imbalance"—could offer water ritual to temper it, tying to her cure quest.
> - **[[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]:** Views his knightly order as "stagnant stone"—possible tension if Sabriel sees Thring's urges as a threat; crossover in border bogs.
> - **[[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]:** No direct tie, but her smuggling could intersect with Thring's wandering (e.g., she delivers a "chaos relic" unknowingly).
> - **Key NPCs:** [[Qui’Gar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End|Qui’Gar]] (sibling to Oove; Thring's clan revered her thorny "endings" as chaos renewal); potential knowledge of Fanewraith (rebel whispers in bogs as "chaotic ally").

## **Gnirth's Ooze Visions (Variation A - Horror Focus)**

When Gnirth touches or is exposed to the black ooze, or when the GM spends Fear to trigger a vision, he experiences fragmented memories of the cataclysm. These visions come in waves, each more horrifying than the last, revealing his role in the corruption's spread.

**Vision 1: The Ritual Circle** - Read out to Gnirth
> The ooze feels warm, almost alive, against your skin. For a moment, you're back in Tideveil Enclave. You stand in a circle of your clan, chanting words you can't remember but feel in your bones. The air shimmers with water magic, and before you—a massive water elemental, bound and thrashing. Someone hands you a pouch of dark dust. "For renewal," they whisper. "To cleanse the stagnation." You pour it into the ritual circle, and the elemental screams.

**Vision 2: The Fusion**
> The world fractures. Water and dust collide, and something breaks. The elemental's form twists, black veins spreading through its liquid body like ink in water. It's no longer water—it's something else. Something that hungers. The ritual circle glows too bright, and you feel power surge through you—raw, chaotic, intoxicating. This is what renewal feels like. This is what you wanted. Isn't it?

**Vision 3: The Flood**
> The ground cracks. Water erupts—but it's wrong. Black, thick, moving like tar. It doesn't flow—it consumes. Your clan members run, but the flood is faster. You watch them fall, their bodies petrifying as the corrupted water touches them. Stone statues, frozen in terror. You're still standing, still channeling, still feeding the ritual. The power feels good. Too good. You can't stop.

**Vision 4: The Explosion**
> A sound like the world breaking. In the distance—or is it the future?—you see it: a flash of light, a god falling. Bolgin. The explosion ripples through reality itself. Your ritual, your flood, your corruption—it amplifies. The black water spreads faster, further. You didn't cause the explosion, but you fed it. Your chaos became its fuel. The Witherwild didn't just spread—it evolved.

**Vision 5: The Awakening**
> You're drowning. No—you're floating. The black water holds you, cradles you. It whispers: "You are mine. You always were." You open your eyes—or do you? Everything is dark, but you can see. Your clan is gone. The enclave is ruins. And you... you remember nothing. Nothing except the void. The hunger. The need to twist, to corrupt, to renew through destruction. This is who you are now. This is what you made.

**Vision 6: The Truth**
> The vision sharpens. You see yourself—Thring—smuggling dust to Haven patrols. "For the stagnant," you tell yourself. "For renewal." But the dust spreads. Creatures change. The corruption grows. You didn't just cause the cataclysm—you're still spreading it. Every urge, every compulsion, every time you twist a corpse or call the void—you're feeding the very thing you're fighting. The ooze isn't just calling to you. It's part of you. You're part of it.

**GM Notes:**
- Trigger these visions when Gnirth touches ooze, fails saves against ooze effects, or when GM spends Fear.
- Each vision reveals more truth, building horror and guilt.
- Visions can grant clues (e.g., "The dust came from the east" or "Someone gave it to you") but also inflict Fear.
- After Vision 6, Gnirth may realize he needs to confront his past to break free from the void's hold.
- Use these to build toward a revelation quest where Gnirth must return to Tideveil Enclave ruins.
