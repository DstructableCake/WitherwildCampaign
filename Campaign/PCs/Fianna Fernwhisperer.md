## Playing [[Amanda]]

## History/Info

Fianna is a member of the Feathersong Kin, followers of Nikta who live in a glade called The Whitefeather Circle. She stands for balance, respect of nature and animals, and respect of Nikta. Her father vanished soon after Nikta was maimed, her companion [[Brindle]] was tainted and tried to kill her, and her Kin have become divided between peace and violence.


## What They Want

- Find out what happened to her father
- Find a cure for Brindle
- ⁠Find out what has been done with Nikta’s Reaping Eye. If it hasn’t been destroyed, locate it, somehow steal it back and return it to Nikta
- ⁠If Suz’s character has met up with Fianna and they are travelling together, help Fern find a way to save her Grove


## What They Know

•⁠  ⁠Respect - our lives are bound to Nikta’s. We must respect her and do whatever best serves Her and the Balance.
•⁠  ⁠Deflect - peace and tranquility lead to harmony and balance. Fighting and violence lead to the opposite. Violence should be avoided or mitigated wherever possible.
•⁠  ⁠Protect - animals, insects, children and the vulnerable must be protected and cared for

## Relations

[[Nikta, the Great Owl]] - Worships
[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] - Met in travels from the grove

[[Brindle]] - fox with antlers, bonded animal who got taken over by the witherwild

Possible:
[[Theodore Underbrush]] - Father, Halfling, travelling Bard(?), vanished soon after Nikta’s eye was taken and the Witherwild curse began. Why did he leave? is he the traitor?
[[Fionnula]] (fin-OO-la) Fernwhisperer - Mother, Faun, has lived in the glade all her life 
[[Shaela Sagebloom]] - Spiritual leader of the Feathersong Kin, espouses peace, tranquility and balance
[[Caitlin Cloverleaf]] - prominent member of Feathersong Council, leads a rebel faction within the Kin who have been training to become Vengeance Guardians since the attack on Nikta
