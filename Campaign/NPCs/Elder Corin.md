## Appearance

Charismatic human scholar in his middle years, with an academic bearing that suggests years spent in libraries and archives. His face is intelligent and approachable, with eyes that seem to hold deep knowledge—though those who look closely might notice a calculating glint behind the scholarly facade.

He dresses in fine academic robes that mark his position as a Loreborne scholar and council member. The robes are well-maintained and professional, suggesting someone who takes care with appearances. He moves with the confidence of someone who knows he has access to information others don't.

His voice is smooth and persuasive, used to sharing knowledge and appearing helpful. He can make complex information seem clear and trustworthy, making him an effective manipulator. Those who trust him may find themselves sharing information they shouldn't, or acting on advice that serves rebel goals rather than their own.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a charismatic, middle-aged human scholar in a fantasy setting. He is a council member and archivist in a treetop city, but secretly works as a spy. Physical description: intelligent, approachable face with calculating eyes that suggest hidden motives behind a scholarly facade, middle-aged (40s-50s), well-groomed appearance. He wears fine academic robes in scholarly colors (deep blues, rich browns, or dark greens) that are well-maintained and professional, showing his position as a Loreborne scholar. The robes should have the look of someone who spends time in libraries and archives—perhaps with small ink stains, or the weight of books in the fabric. He may have a scroll or book nearby, or be in a library/archive setting. His bearing is confident and knowledgeable, suggesting someone with access to information others don't. The setting should be a scholarly environment—a library, archive, or study—with shelves of books, scrolls, and documents. The atmosphere should convey intelligence, knowledge, and trustworthiness on the surface, but with subtle hints of hidden motives (perhaps shadows, or a calculating expression, or hidden objects). The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with warm library lighting that creates a sense of knowledge and trust, but with subtle elements that suggest there's more beneath the surface.
