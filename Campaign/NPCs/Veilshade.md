## Playing Veilshade
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Veilshade (she/her) is a masked zealot—voice low and resonating, like dust settling after a storm, yet capable of fiery, charismatic surges. Roleplay her as a populist orator, calm and maternal when speaking to the "suffering masses," but with a hidden, simmering fury for the "elites."
> 
> Stand out: She wears a veil of petrified leaves, covering her face and hinting at Sickness scars beneath. She gestures with hands that subtly shimmer with fine dust, and sometimes small, thorny blooms (Withered) briefly sprout from her clothing.
> 
> In scenes, she appears unexpectedly in neglected areas (slums, quarantined zones, corrupted fields), delivering impassioned speeches or overseeing subtle sabotage. She's strategic, using rhetoric and engineered chaos to empower the forgotten—perfect for morally gray confrontations (e.g., "They hoard the cure while we choke on dust! Which side are you on?"). 
> 
> Voice line: "Equality in dust—for only when all have suffered, shall true balance bloom!" Use to heighten class conflict and present uncomfortable truths to the party.

## History/Info
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Veilshade (she/her, ~35, Firbolg, real name [[Lira Thorne]]) rose from Haven's impoverished border slums. A former lowborn herbalist, she watched her entire community petrify during the **[[Serpents Sickness]]** epidemic (2-3 years ago) while **[[Haven]]**'s highborne elites hoarded the scarce crimson lady's veil. She contracted the Sickness but survived through sheer will, awakening a unique **"dustweaving"** skill—an innate ability to manipulate Sickness dust into nascent plant-like forms without personal harm (likely a Wither mutation from the omnipresent dust and her herbalist past, but she believes it's a divine gift to humble the elite). No blood ties to any major **[[Fanewick]]** or **[[Haven]]** NPCs; she's a product of systemic neglect.Key Events:
> 
> - "Community petrified during Sickness outbreak (2-3 years ago), fueling her populist rage."
> - "Survived Sickness, awakening innate 'dustweaving' ability (2 years ago)."
> - "Formed the Dustveil Collective to 'equalize' suffering across Haven's poor and Fanewick's Withered (1 year ago)."
> 
> Secrets:
> 
> - "Her 'dustweaving' slowly, secretly, consumes her own remaining vitality; she privately gains Wither tokens, fearing her own full corruption (a private ticking clock)."
> - "Maintains a 'ledger of equality' listing Haven elites targeted for Dustveil outbreaks, including detailed intel on **[[Phylax]]**."
> - "Believes her skill is a manifestation of **[[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid]]**'s lingering will for universal petrification, a 'final judgment' for Haven's pride."
> - "Has a hidden, petrified flower garden in a quarantined Haven district, where she speaks to the statues of her loved ones."
> 
> Current Situation: Veilshade operates from decentralized cells across border zones (Stolen Fen, quarantined Haven districts). She inspires the Dustveil Collective to engineer hybrid outbreaks to "equalize" suffering. She monitors the party's movements, looking for opportunities to expose Haven's failures or sway Wickling PCs to her side.Appearance: General: Medium height, lean frame; shrouded in a dark, patched cloak that seems to absorb light. Distinguishing Features:
> 
> - **"Mask: A veil woven from intricately petrified leaves, concealing her face. It seems to shift subtly as she speaks."**
> - "Hands often shimmer with fine, almost invisible dust, or sprout small, thorny Wither blooms (which she casually brushes away)."
> - "Eyes burn with a quiet, fierce conviction, reflecting light even in dim conditions."Items:
> - "A small, unassuming pouch of purified Sickness dust (her tool for Dustveil outbreaks)."
> - "Hidden 'equality ledger' (lists targets for sabotage/outbreaks)."
> 
> Personality: Charismatic orator, commanding loyalty through shared pain; driven by quiet fury and a burning desire for justice. Motivated by equality—believes true balance comes from universal suffering and the humbling of the powerful. Quirk: Occasionally whispers to her mask or the dust in her hands; has a faint, almost imperceptible tremor in her voice when speaking of personal loss, quickly masked by conviction.

## What They Want
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Short-Term:** Engineer targeted "Dustveil" outbreaks in Haven's highborne districts or against Wickling "collaborators" (e.g., forced farmers in **[[Stolen Fen]]**). Recruit more followers among the poor and Withered. Views party as potential allies (especially Wickling PCs) or necessary obstacles. (GM Tip: Offer "inside knowledge" on Haven's vulnerabilities, or "healing" for Withered traits, to sway PCs.)
> - **Long-Term:** Topple **[[Haven]]**'s elite-dominated hierarchy and force a societal "reckoning," where resources are shared equally or no one gets them. Allow the **[[WitherWild]]** to complete its "evolution," purifying the land by consuming the "old" order. (Hook: If PCs aid an outbreak, Veilshade offers a more ambitious target, like a wealthy merchant convoy.)
> - **Hidden Agenda:** Fully merge her "dustweaving" skill with the Witherwild, potentially becoming a living embodiment of the Dustveil, beyond her current hybrid state. She believes this is the ultimate form of "equality." If opposed, she will use her abilities to create chaos or turn the very land/environment against the PCs. (Lever: If PCs uncover her personal suffering or her secret Dustveil tokens, they can try to appeal to her humanity, potentially redeeming her or radicalizing her further.)

%%
## What They Know
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Veilshade's knowledge stems from the Haven undercity's whispers, its neglected poor, and her growing connection to the Witherwild's inherent growth. She knows where the cracks are in Haven's facade. (GM Tip: Roll Finesse or Instinct for revelations, as her knowledge is often gleaned from observation and the "dust's whispers," potentially inflicting 1 Wither token on the PC if they push for too much sensitive info.)
> 
> - **About Fanewraith:** Sees her as a volatile ally, "a necessary thorn," but one too focused on "primal vengeance" rather than systematic "equality." Knows Fanewraith's desire for the Sowing Eye and specific sabotage targets.
> - **About Witherwild/Sickness:** Understands the Sickness is **[[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid]]**'s vengeance against **[[Haven]]**, and the Witherwild is the land's response. She has a deep, personal understanding of how both interact to create hybrid abominations. (Details: Believes the _dust_ itself is intelligent, and her 'dustweaving' connects to this intelligence; hints at **[[Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom]]**'s hidden domains).
> - **On PCs:**
>     - **[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]]** (Fungril Hedge Witch): Views her as a potential ideological ally, as a magic-user from a corrupted grove, offering a chance to "evolve" her village's magic. ("Your blooms know decay; teach them true growth, for all.")
>     - **[[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]]** (Nikta Worshiper): Sees her grief for **[[Brindle]]** and Nikta as a shared pain. Tries to convert her to the "equality in suffering" philosophy. ("Your owl god weeps alone; my dust blooms for everyone's pain.")
>     - **[[Gnirth]]** (Fungril Sorcerer): Intrigued by his lost memories and elemental urges; believes his "void" is a natural manifestation of the world's imbalance, and that the Dustveil can fill it. ("Your lost self seeks wholeness; the dust offers truth through shared experience.")
>     - **[[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]** (Haven Knight): Views him as a symbol of Haven's oppressive order, but respects his 'atonement' if genuine. Challenges his principles, asking if he serves the elite or the meek. ("Your faith serves stone walls; will it serve suffering souls?")
>     - **[[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]** (Goblin Rogue): Knows her smuggling network is vital; sees her scars as proof of Sickness's inequality. Offers a direct appeal to join, providing secure routes and potential "cures" for loved ones in exchange for loyalty. ("Your scars speak of their greed; my dust empowers us all.")
> - **PC Knowledge:** Uses spies and Dustveil outbreaks to learn PC weaknesses, leveraging their grief, loyalty, or vulnerabilities to tempt them into her cause.

## Relations
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **To PCs:** Charismatic recruiter/manipulator—rewards cooperation with information/safe passage, punishes opposition with targeted Dustveil outbreaks or propaganda against them. Fern: Ideal convert. Fianna: Spiritual kin in suffering. Gnirth: Elemental anomaly, potential weapon. Sabriel: Object for conversion or confrontation. Snicket: Operational asset. (GM Tip: Use Veilshade to sow seeds of doubt about Haven and Fanewraith; she's adept at exposing hypocrisy.)
> - **To Key NPCs:****[[Phylax]]** (arch-rival—symbol of elite hoarding; a primary target for Dustveil outbreaks). **[[Kreil Durn|Kreil]]** (clever but futile—tries to intercept her messages; she sees him as a desperate dog of the elite). **[[Fanewraith]]** (opportunistic ally—sees her as too chaotic, but useful for anti-Haven operations). **[[Governor Hale]]** (personal vendetta—his family benefited from early veils; she targets his district for outbreaks). **[[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]** (benevolent partner—Hyacynis provides blooms for the Dustveil, seeing it as amplified growth).
> - **Factions:**
>     - "Allies: The Dustveil Collective (leads them), **[[Withered Covenant]]** (accepts them as transformed kin), **[[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms]]** (source of corrupted blooms), Haven's disillusioned poor (recruits from)."
>     - "Enemies: **[[Haven Military Academy|Haven]]** elites, **[[Knights of the Stone Serpent]]** (seen as enforcers), **[[Wicklings|Wickling]]** 'collaborators' (e.g., forced farmers in Stolen Fen)."
>     - "Stance: A populist equalizer—seeks to end class disparities by making all suffer equally, leading to a new, transformed order. Her methods are justified by Haven's initial hubris."

## Stat Block
DM
%%

> [!INFo]
> Veilshade is a Tier 3 Elite (charismatic Dustweaver with hybrid control). (GM Tip: Her encounters often involve social maneuvering and environmental hazards over direct combat; her abilities focus on spreading conditions and control, not raw damage. If she enters combat, she prefers to use Dustveil agents as minions and creates terrain hazards, frustrating the party.)
> 
> - **Core Stats:** Agility 14, Finesse 16, Instinct 16, Knowledge 14, Presence 18, Strength 10. HP: {"max": 50, "thresholds": [40, 25, 10]}. Armor: 1 (veiled cloak). Evasion: 16.
> - **Skills:** {"Persuasion": "Expert", "Deception": "Proficient", "Intimidation": "Proficient", "Nature": "Proficient"}. (Advantage on rolls to sway crowds or expose hypocrisy.)
> - **Saves:** {"Finesse": "+6", "Presence": "+8"}. (Resistance to charm/fear from her conviction.)
> - **Resistances:** ["Disease (Sickness-immune)", "Poison (Dustweaving-attuned)", "Fear (from conviction)"].
> - **Vulnerabilities:** ["Personal loss (appeals to her grief for her family can give PCs advantage on Presence rolls against her).", "Direct physical combat (prefers to use minions).", "Exposure of her Sickness scars (if her mask is removed/destroyed, she gains 1 Wither token and loses her Presence resistance for 1 round)."]
> - **Abilities:**
>     - {"name": "Dustweave Bloom", "description": "Action: Target an area (20-ft radius) or a creature; fill it with motes of Sickness dust. Creatures in area or target take 1d6 psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Instinct save or gain 1 Wither token. On a critical failure, they also gain a temporary Sickness symptom. (Ties to Snicket's scars, Sabriel's hometown)."}
>     - {"name": "Populist Command", "description": "Bonus Action: Inspire 1d4 nearby allies or enraged citizens (treat as Minions with HP 10) to attack foes or create a diversion. If target is a PC, can offer them advantage on their next roll if they act in line with her goals (e.g., Sabriel protecting a civilian, Gnirth using water magic to spread dust)."}
>     - {"name": "Veiled Retreat", "description": "Reaction: When targeted by an attack, create a cloud of obscuring dust (10-ft radius, heavy obscurement) and move up to 30 ft. away without provoking Opportunity Attacks. (She uses this to escape direct confrontation)."}
>     - {"name": "Equality's Echo", "description": "Free Action (once per short rest): Reveal a secret about a powerful NPC's hypocrisy or hidden weakness (e.g., Phylax's experimental treatments, Hale's kickbacks). (GM Tip: Use this to fuel the B Plot's populist themes and give PCs new targets.)"}
> - **Plot Hooks:**
>     - "PCs arrive at a Haven quarantine zone (e.g., a deserted street in Sabriel's hometown) and find propaganda posters from Veilshade, subtly blaming the elites for the Sickness and calling for 'equality in dust.'"
>     - "A local C Plot (e.g., clearing a Withered forest section) is interrupted by a sudden Dustveil outbreak, turning trees into petrified-plant hybrids and forcing PCs to choose between fighting the hybrids or containing the dust."
>     - "Snicket's smuggling contact (e.g., **[[Albert]]**) is targeted by a Dustveil outbreak, disrupting her supply lines and forcing her to confront Veilshade to restore her business."
>     - "Veilshade broadcasts a 'sermon' from **[[Cackling Moor]]** via corrupted plant whispers, reaching Fianna and Gnirth through their ancestral networks and challenging their views on balance and suffering."

## Speeches 

### Speech 1
%%

> [!note]
> "They speak of progress, of prosperity! But what do _we_ see? We see dust. We see sickness. We see the rot of neglect eating away at our very bones. They hoard their cures, their comfort, while we choke on the poisoned air they exhale. But we are not forgotten! We are the soil from which true growth shall emerge. We are the forgotten, the neglected, the ones they wish to erase. And soon, very soon, our bloom will be undeniable."

%%
### Speech 2
%%

> [!NOTE]
> "To the suffering masses, the forgotten souls of Haven and its fringes! The elites, in their gilded towers, feast while you starve. They preach order, but their order is a cage built of despair. They hoard life's precious elixirs, leaving you to petrify. But there is a balance coming. A reckoning. For too long, the scales have been tipped. It is time to level them. It is time for equality. Equality in dust, for only when all have suffered, shall true balance bloom!"

%%
### Speech 3
%%

> [!NOTE]
> "Look at your hands, my kin. See the shimmer? Feel the bloom that struggles to emerge? This is not a curse. This is a transformation. This is the land's answer to their hubris. They gave us sickness; we will give them understanding. They offered neglect; we will offer unity. The Sickness they unleashed upon us, the dust that claims the weak, will be the great equalizer. It will humble their pride, and from the ashes of their order, a new world will blossom, a world where all share the same, beautiful, inevitable dust."

%%
### Speech 4
%%

> [!NOTE]
> "You walk these streets, you breathe this dust. You see the suffering. Tell me, who do you serve? The gilded few who hoard the crimson lady's veil while your brothers and sisters petrify? Or do you stand with those who remember the taste of dust, the ache in their bones, the hollow echo of loss? The path of 'order' they offer is a path to annihilation for us all. The path of true equality, of shared suffering, is the only path to genuine survival. Choose wisely, for the dust is already settling."
