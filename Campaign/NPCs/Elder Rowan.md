## History / Info

Elder Rowan is the youngest member of the Elder Council, elevated to the position after the Thorngrowth Incident created vacancies and the need for new voices. He lost family members in the disaster—parents, siblings, or close relatives who were killed or dragged into the corrupted depths by the twisted treant.

The trauma of that loss, combined with his youth and idealism, made him a perfect target for radicalization. He came to believe that traditional methods had failed, and that only extreme measures could prevent another disaster. Evelyn and the rebel network recognized his potential and helped guide his radicalization, using his pain and anger to serve their goals.

## Appearance

Young elf with a passionate, intense expression that shows both idealism and the weight of trauma. His face is marked by the pain of loss, but also by the fire of someone who has found purpose in radical action. His eyes burn with conviction, but those who look closely might see the vulnerability beneath the anger.

He dresses in modified traditional Wildborne clothing that shows his position as council member, but with elements that reflect his radicalization—perhaps darker colors, or symbols of the rebellion, or modifications that show his break from tradition. He carries himself with the confidence of someone who believes he has found the right path, but also with the tension of someone who is still processing grief.

His movements are sharp and decisive, reflecting his commitment to action over deliberation. He often positions himself near the Spire Approach (Tree 6B), where he can see the corrupted area that took his family, using it as both reminder and motivation.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a young, passionate elf man in a fantasy forest setting. He is a radicalized council member in a treetop city, marked by trauma and loss. Physical description: young adult elf (appears in 20s-30s in human terms), intense and passionate expression showing both idealism and the weight of trauma, eyes that burn with conviction but reveal vulnerability beneath the anger, face marked by the pain of loss but also the fire of someone who has found purpose. He wears modified traditional Wildborne clothing—earth tones (browns, greens) but perhaps darker or with radical symbols—that shows his position as council member but also his break from tradition. The clothing may have elements that reflect his radicalization (darker colors, symbols, modifications). He carries a traditional Wildborne spear, well-used, showing his connection to nature and combat. He may have tokens or mementos from a traumatic event visible (perhaps worn on his person). The setting should be near a corrupted or dangerous area (suggesting the Spire), with a mix of natural beauty and visible corruption or threat. The atmosphere should convey passion, conviction, trauma, and radicalization—someone who has been changed by loss and found purpose in extreme action. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with dramatic lighting that shows both the fire of conviction and the shadows of loss, showing the textures of his clothing and the intensity of his expression.
