## Appearance

Ribbet smuggler with the lean, agile build of someone who spends their life moving through shadows and tight spaces. Her face shows the experience of someone who has learned to read situations quickly and move silently, with eyes that are always assessing routes and potential dangers.

She dresses in practical, dark clothing that allows her to blend into shadows—nothing that would draw attention, but functional for moving through the city's vertical structure. Her movements are quiet and efficient, reflecting her nickname and her skill at avoiding detection.

Her bearing is cautious but confident, the kind of person who knows they can navigate dangerous situations but prefers to avoid them. She speaks little, but when she does, her words are measured and valuable.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a lean, agile Ribbet smuggler in a fantasy setting. They are a smuggler in a treetop city who knows secret routes. Physical description: lean, agile build showing someone who moves through shadows and tight spaces, experienced face with eyes that are always assessing routes and dangers, Ribbet features (amphibian-like characteristics, perhaps webbed fingers, or subtle aquatic traits), cautious but confident bearing. They wear practical, dark clothing in muted colors (grays, dark browns, blacks) that allows them to blend into shadows—functional for moving through vertical city structure, nothing that draws attention. The clothing should be well-worn but maintained, showing someone who values practicality. They should be in a shadowy, underground setting—perhaps a tavern, smuggling den, or hidden passage—with the atmosphere of someone who operates in the shadows. The setting should convey secrecy, navigation, and the vertical structure of a treetop city (rope bridges, platforms, shadows). The atmosphere should convey experience, caution, and knowledge of hidden paths. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with shadowy lighting that creates a sense of someone who moves through darkness, showing the textures of practical clothing and the alert expression of someone who knows how to navigate dangerous situations.
