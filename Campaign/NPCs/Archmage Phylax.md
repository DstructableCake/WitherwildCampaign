## Playing Phylax
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Phylax (they/them) is a brilliant, burdened visionary—voice calm but edged with desperation, like cracking stone. Roleplay them as intellectual and authoritative, quoting ancient texts while coughing dust.
> 
> Stand out: Their skin shows early scaling (Sickness), and they wield a staff topped with a facsimile Reaping Eye (glowing ominously).
> 
> In scenes, they're strategic, using magic for emphasis (e.g., illusions of petrified victims)—perfect for tense councils or confrontations. Voice line: "The ends are etched in stone; question them, and you carve your own grave." Use to heighten moral tension—e.g., scry PCs during downtime, revealing a personal secret to pressure them.

%%
## History/Info

Archmage Phylax (~60s human) is Haven's High Magus, a genius arcanist who rose through the wizarding school by innovating anti-divine wards.
%%
> [!INFO]
> Discovering crimson lady’s veil as the Sickness cure (2 years ago), they masterminded the invasion and Eye theft (1 year ago) to save Haven—unleashing Witherwild. Now plagued by guilt (and early Sickness), they justify actions as "necessary evil," but doubt creeps in.
> 
> They command Haven's mages/army, but Kreil's subtle dissent strains loyalty. 
> 
> Secrets: Haunted by Shun’Aush dreams (Fear Die trigger for PCs nearby); experiments with Witherwild for weapons. 
> 
> Plot hook: If PCs infiltrate Haven, Phylax debates philosophy mid-battle, offering mercy for aid.

%%
Appearance: Tall, robed in serpent-embroidered silks, with ashen hair and scaling scars. Eyes glow faintly.
%%
> [!INFO]
> Personality: Ruthless pragmatist; debates philosophy while ordering invasions. Motivated by legacy—fears being remembered as Haven's destroyer. Quirk: Pauses to consult a dusty tome mid-conversation, ignoring interruptions.
%%
## What They Want
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - Short-Term: Mass-produce veil cures; suppress Witherwild/Fanewraith threats. Views party as tools via Kreil— if they retrieve Eye, seize it for Haven. (GM Tip: Offer veiled bribes like anti-Sickness tonics during negotiations.)
>   
> - Long-Term: Eradicate Sickness permanently (e.g., via Shun’Aush ruins). Open to uneasy peace if it saves Haven, but prioritizes dominance. (Hook: Propose alliance if PCs prove Witherwild control.)
>   
> - Hidden Agenda: Experiment with Witherwild for weapons (ties to Druid's flowers—might steal her research). If PCs oppose, frame as traitors (Sabriel hook). (Lever: If a PC shows Sickness symptoms, Phylax offers experimental cure—for a favor.)

%%
## What They Know
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Phylax's arcane knowledge is vast—uses scrying for intel. (GM Tip: Roll Arcana for revelations; tie to session prep by having them "foresee" PC actions via weft glimpses.)
> 
> - On Fanewraith: Knows her identity ([[Fanewraith|Elara Voss]]), grove plans—sees as terrorist. (Details: Her bramble crown is a Wither artifact.)
>   
> - On Witherwild/Sickness: Full history; experiments with hybrid cures (hints at Druid: "Rebel blooms intrigue me"). Knows dust origins from Shun’Aush.
> - On PCs:
> 
> 	- [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] (Fungril Hedge Witch): Knows her corrupted grove via scrying; recruits for network access ("Your midnight blooms could cure us all—join or wither").
> 	- [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]] (Nikta Worshiper): Mocks devotion as "owl superstition"; threatens Brindle's taint ("Your fox is our doing—return the Eye to end it").
> 	- [[Gnirth]] (Fungril Sorcerer): Intrigued by water urges/memory loss; offers restoration ("Elemental voids? I can fill them—for a price").
> 	- [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] (Haven Knight): Respects order; offers promotion for loyalty ("Your Stone Serpent vows align—serve, or be cast as traitor").
> 	- [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]] (Goblin Rogue): Knows smuggling via spies; blackmails with ear scars ("Your dust marks? I can heal them—if you spy").
> 
> - PC Knowledge: Scrys PC weaknesses (e.g., "Your doubts, knight, are... useful"). Knows party origins via spies (e.g., if from Fanewick, accuses of sabotage).

%%
## Relations
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - To PCs: Patronizing ally—rewards loyalty (e.g., magic items), punishes dissent (e.g., scry traps). 
> 	- Fern: Potential asset. 
> 	- Fianna: Religious rival. 
> 	- Gnirth: Experimental subject. 
> 	- Sabriel: Successor. 
> 	- Snicket: Disposable spy. 
> - (GM Tip: Use relations to create personalized hooks—e.g., send a vision to Fianna mocking Nikta.)
>   
> - To Key NPCs: [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]] (tool—suspects disloyalty). [[Fanewraith]] (hated fanatic). [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]] (tool—Eye as "necessary theft"; fears her full wrath).
>   
> - Factions: Haven ruler; despises [[Wicklings|Wickling]] as "primitive," but allies if beneficial (e.g., pragmatic Wardens). 
> - Enemies: Insurgents, Withered Covenant. (Lever: If [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] pushes peace, Phylax offers truce talks but demands [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]'s smuggling network.)
