# Silas "Thornfoot"

## Playing Silas [DM Notes]

Silas "Thornfoot" (he/him) is a Riverwalker Ranger—voice quiet and precise, rarely wasting a word.

Roleplay him as wary but fair, judging people by how they speak of land, beasts, and kin. He moves with the silence of someone who has spent a lifetime in the wild, reading signs others miss.

Stand out: Lean, weathered frame; braided hair bound with river reeds; bare feet hardened by forest floor; thorn tattoos spiral up his calves in intricate patterns. Leather armor dyed in forest tones—greens, browns, and earth colors that help him blend into surroundings.

In scenes, he is the guardian of boundaries—respectful of those who respect the land, dangerous to those who don't. He speaks in short, meaningful phrases, and his eyes miss nothing.

Voice line: *"River remembers bootprints longer than banners."*
