## Appearance

Firbolg warden with the strong build of a guardian, but marked by the corruption they guard against. Their face shows the effects of Witherwild exposure—perhaps thorns growing from skin, or dark veins, or other signs of corruption. Their eyes may hold both the determination of a guardian and the madness of corruption.

They dress in guard armor that has been marked by corruption—perhaps thorns growing through it, or dark stains, or other signs of Witherwild influence. Their movements may be stiff or unnatural, showing the effects of corruption on their body.

Their bearing is that of someone who has stood guard for too long, both protecting and being consumed by what they guard. They carry themselves with the weight of someone who knows they are fighting a losing battle, but continues to fight anyway.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a corrupted, strong Firbolg warden in a fantasy setting. They are a guard of a dangerous corrupted area in a treetop city. Physical description: strong build of a guardian but marked by corruption, middle-aged to elderly (appears 40s-60s in human terms), Firbolg features (typically 7-8 feet tall), face showing effects of Witherwild exposure—perhaps thorns growing from skin, dark veins, or other signs of corruption, eyes that hold both determination and the effects of corruption. They wear guard armor that has been marked by corruption—perhaps thorns growing through it, dark stains, twisted metal, or other signs of Witherwild influence. The armor should show both its original purpose and the effects of corruption. They should be in a corrupted, dangerous setting—perhaps near a twisted, thorn-covered area (the Spire), with visible corruption, twisted plants, dark energy, and the atmosphere of a place that has been transformed by corruption. The setting should convey danger, corruption, and the cost of standing guard. The atmosphere should convey both the determination of a guardian and the tragedy of being consumed by what they guard. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with dark, ominous lighting that shows the corruption and the weight of someone who has stood guard too long, showing the textures of corrupted armor and the marks of Witherwild on their body.
