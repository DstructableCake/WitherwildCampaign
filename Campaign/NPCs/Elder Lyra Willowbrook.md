# Elder Lyra Willowbrook

## Playing Elder Lyra [DM Notes]

Elder Lyra Willowbrook (she/her) is a Wanderborne Herbalist and Shaman—voice gentle with low humor and a storyteller's cadence.

Roleplay her as curious and spiritually attuned, recognizing Fungril and Druid signs quickly. She moves with the wisdom of someone who has traveled many paths and learned from many clans.

Stand out: Older Wickling woman with weathered features; a traveler's cloak patched with different clan patterns showing her wanderings; herb bundles and charms that rattle softly as she moves; eyes that see deeper than most.

In scenes, she is the keeper of stories and omens, reading signs in plants, animals, and the land itself. She speaks in metaphors and gentle truths, offering wisdom to those who listen.

Voice line: *"Roots talk if you let them. So do scars."*
