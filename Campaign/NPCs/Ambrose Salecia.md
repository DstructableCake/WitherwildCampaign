## Playing Ambrose
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> An [[Inferni]] who had retired before the sickness tore through haven. she re-enlisted to make up numbers for the assault on the black marsh a decision she still struggles with. Suffers with insomnia and night terrors. She's reclused herself into academia searching for a way to end the occupation of fanewick either by making the red flowers more populous or a different cure entirely.
> 
> [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]], [[Valerius D'sousza|Valerius]] and Ambrose met for the first time while preparing for the assault on the black marsh. Sabriel and his fellow knights of the border were assigned to Valerius as the vanguard since they were more familiar with [[Fanewick]] than most. there was a 2-4 month training and prep before the attack. So few survived and made it back into Haven that they keep loosely in touch.
