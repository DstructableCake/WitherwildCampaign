## Appearance

Fungril spiritual guide with the gentle, wise presence of someone deeply connected to the spiritual realm. Her face shows the kindness and compassion of someone who has spent years helping others, with eyes that seem to see beyond the physical world into the realm of omens and divinities.

She dresses in simple but meaningful clothing—spiritual robes in natural colors, decorated with symbols of the divinities she serves. Her Fungril nature is visible in subtle ways—perhaps the texture of her skin, or the way she moves with connection to the natural world around her.

Her bearing is calm and protective, creating an atmosphere of safety and spiritual guidance. She moves with the deliberate care of someone who understands the importance of her role, both as shrine keeper and as protector of the vulnerable.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a gentle, wise Fungril spiritual guide in a fantasy setting. She is a shrine keeper in a treetop city who maintains shrines and protects a vulnerable child. Physical description: gentle, wise face with kind, compassionate eyes that seem to see beyond the physical world, middle-aged to elderly (appears 40s-60s in human terms), Fungril features (mushroom-like cap as hat, fungal textures, connection to nature), calm and protective bearing. She wears simple but meaningful spiritual robes in natural colors (earth tones, soft greens, muted browns) decorated with symbols of divinities—perhaps feathers, crystals, or natural materials. The clothing should be practical but spiritual, showing her role as shrine keeper. She should be in a spiritual setting—perhaps a shrine, observatory, or refugee area—with spiritual items visible (crystals, feathers, natural materials, shrine decorations, divination tools). The atmosphere should convey wisdom, kindness, spiritual connection, and protection. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with soft, warm lighting that creates a sense of spiritual guidance and safety, showing the textures of her robes, the natural materials, and the gentle expression of someone who provides spiritual support and protection.
