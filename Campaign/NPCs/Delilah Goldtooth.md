![[Delilah Goldtooth Portrait.png||300]]
## Playing Delilah Goldtooth

Delilah Goldtooth (she/her) is a sharp-eyed orc merchant with a knack for making deals that look legitimate on the surface but hide a dozen side arrangements underneath. 

Voice warm but sly, with a laugh that can disarm or intimidate depending on her mood. 

Stand out: Gold-capped tusks, bright patterned scarf, heavy coin bracelets that jingle when she moves, and a ledger that never leaves her side. 

In scenes, she’s always multitasking — counting coins, sorting goods, or haggling — while keeping one ear on the conversation. She’s fiercely loyal to those she trusts, but will test newcomers before offering anything of value. 

Voice line: _“Every deal’s a gamble, love. The trick is making sure the other player doesn’t know the odds.”_ 

For your party, Delilah is [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]’s anchor in [[Stolen Fen]] — a source of smuggling work, local gossip, and discreet supplies. She can also be a bridge to [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]]’s network if you want to tie the smuggling world to the spymaster’s plots.

## History/Info

Delilah is the younger sister of **[[Samson Goldtooth]]**, the orc shopkeeper who took Snicket in as an apprentice and ran a smuggling ring under the cover of a general store. 

When Samson fell victim to the Serpent Sickness, Delilah inherited his contacts and routes — but she runs them with a more cautious, calculated style. 

She set up shop in **Stolen Fen** to take advantage of the white flower trade, using her legitimate stall as a front for moving rare herbs, dust-proof gear, and red flower potion. She’s well-connected in both Haven and Fanewick, and she knows how to keep her head down when trouble comes.

---

## What They Want

- **Short-Term:** Keep her trade routes open and profitable without drawing Haven’s tax collectors or Fanewick’s wardens.
- **Mid-Term:** Expand her influence in Stolen Fen’s market, pushing out less reliable traders.
- **Long-Term:** Secure a permanent smuggling corridor between Haven’s undercity and Fanewick’s border towns.

---

## What They Know

- **Local Gossip:** Fishermen have been spooked by “a shadow in the water” near the fen’s edge.
- **Trade Intel:** Knows which Clank overseers can be bribed to look the other way.
- **Political Climate:** Aware that Haven’s interest in Stolen Fen is purely resource-driven — and that the settlement will be abandoned if the fields fail.
- **PC Hooks:**
    - **[[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]:** Treats her like family, but expects her to pull her weight in the network.
    - **[[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]:** Respects his discipline but teases him for being “too honest for his own good.”
    - **[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]]/[[Gnirth]]:** Curious about Fungril goods and magic — sees potential for rare trade items.
    - **[[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]]:** Interested in Nikta-related relics as high-value contraband.

---

## Relations

- **Snicket Surefoot:** Trusted partner; shares Samson’s legacy.
- **Captain Thorne:** Mutual respect — she keeps her smuggling subtle, he pretends not to notice.
- **Other Merchants:** Keeps rivals close, but undercuts them when possible.
- **[[Kreil Durn]]:** Knows of him through smuggling whispers; may have traded information indirectly.
