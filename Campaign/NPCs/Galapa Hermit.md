# Galapa Hermit

## Playing Galapa Hermit [DM Notes]

The Galapa Hermit (they/them) is an amphibious outsider—voice slow with watery consonants, often pausing mid-sentence to think.

Roleplay them as odd and insightful, seeing patterns others miss. They speak in riddles and half-truths, their mind working like water—flowing, shifting, sometimes clear, sometimes murky.

Stand out: Stocky amphibious humanoid with features that suggest both human and aquatic ancestry; moss and lichen growing on shell-like plates that cover parts of their body; uses a carved driftwood staff; often found half in water, half on land.

In scenes, they are the keeper of river memories, knowing what the water was like before corruption and recognizing the echoes of drowned places. They see connections others miss.

Voice line: *"I remember when the river ran clear. I remember when you did not."*
