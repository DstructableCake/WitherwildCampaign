## Appearance

Mid-level guard commander with the professional bearing of someone who has served for years. His face shows the experience of someone who has seen conflict and knows how to maintain order, but those who look closely might notice the tension of someone living a double life.

He dresses in standard guard uniform—practical armor, official insignia, and the equipment of a professional guard. He carries himself with the confidence of someone in a position of authority, but also with the caution of someone who must constantly maintain a facade.

His movements are efficient and professional, reflecting his training and experience. He knows how to appear as a loyal guard while secretly supporting the rebels, a skill that requires constant vigilance and careful balance.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a professional, middle-aged human guard commander in a fantasy setting. He is a mid-level guard commander in a treetop city who secretly works as a rebel spy. Physical description: middle-aged (30s-40s), professional bearing showing years of service, experienced face with the tension of someone living a double life, strong build of a trained guard. He wears standard guard uniform—practical armor in official colors (perhaps blues, grays, or city colors), official insignia showing his rank, sword and shield, and professional guard equipment. The uniform should be well-maintained and show his position of authority. He should be in a guard setting—perhaps a guard post, checkpoint, or patrol route—with guard equipment, city architecture, and the atmosphere of a security position visible. The atmosphere should convey professionalism, authority, and the tension of hidden allegiance. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with clear lighting that shows the professional uniform and equipment, but with subtle elements that suggest there's more beneath the surface (perhaps a hidden token, or a moment of conflict in his expression).
