The robes are practical but elegant, showing her position while maintaining approachability. She carries a simple but elegant wooden staff, symbol of her role. Her hair is styled simply and professionally. The setting should be a formal but welcoming space, such as a council chamber or meeting room, with natural lighting and a sense of order and calm.
