## Playing Valerius [DM Notes]


Valerius D’sousza (he/him) is a dwarf centurion turned instructor. Voice sharp, commanding, with the bite of a drill sergeant. 

Roleplay him as impatient, ill-tempered, but deeply competent. Think J.K. Simmons in _Whiplash_. 

Stand out: Stocky build, scarred face, greying beard, always carrying a cane he slams for emphasis. 

In scenes, he berates recruits, demands discipline, and hides his guilt behind anger. Voice line: _“You think the enemy waits for you to be ready? The marsh doesn’t care about your excuses.”_ 

### **History/Info**

- Distinguished himself in the Northern Campaign against demon cults.
- Nearly promoted to Prior before the disastrous assault on the Black Marsh.
- Retired to the Academy, now sent to the barracks to “shape up” recruits.
- Once respected, now seen as a bitter hard-ass.
