## Appearance

Skilled Firbolg artisan with the strong, practical build of someone who works with their hands. His face shows the focus and attention to detail of a master craftsman, with calloused hands that speak of years spent shaping materials into protective gear and weapons.

He dresses in practical work clothes—sturdy fabrics, leather aprons, and tools at his belt. His workshop is organized but busy, with materials and works-in-progress showing his skill and the variety of his craft. He moves with the efficiency of someone who knows their tools and materials intimately.

His bearing is professional but approachable, the kind of craftsman who takes pride in his work and enjoys discussing techniques and materials. Those who look closely might notice small details that suggest his rebel connections—perhaps a hidden compartment, or materials that seem intended for more than standard equipment.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a skilled, middle-aged Firbolg craftsman in a fantasy workshop setting. He is an armorer and weapon crafter in a treetop city. Physical description: strong, practical build showing someone who works with their hands, middle-aged (40s-50s in human terms), focused expression with the attention to detail of a master craftsman, calloused hands from years of work, tall Firbolg build (typically 7-8 feet tall). He wears practical work clothes—sturdy fabrics in earth tones (browns, tans, natural colors), leather aprons with tool loops, and tools at his belt. The clothing should show wear from work but be well-maintained. He should be in a workshop setting with tools, materials, and works-in-progress visible—armor pieces, weapons, plant-based materials (thorn-reinforced leather, bark-plate, living plant elements), crafting tools (hammers, awls, cutting tools), and organized workbenches. The atmosphere should convey craftsmanship, skill, and practical knowledge. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with warm workshop lighting that shows the textures of materials and tools, creating a sense of a skilled artisan at work in a functional, organized space.
