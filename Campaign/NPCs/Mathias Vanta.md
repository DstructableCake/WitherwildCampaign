## Playing Mathias [DM Notes]

Mathias Vanta (he/him) is a weary but steadfast priest, voice soft and heavy with grief. 

Roleplay him as deeply compassionate, but worn down by decades of loss. He speaks slowly, as if every word is weighed, and often pauses mid-sentence to gather strength. 

Stand out: Gaunt frame, sunken eyes, robes patched and worn. Always keeps a candle burning in the chapel. 

In scenes, he is gentle but unyielding in his faith, offering comfort even when he has none left for himself. 

Voice line: _“You cannot carry them all, Sabriel. The stone is not yours to bear.”_

>     - **Fianna:** May see the statues as a wound in Nikta’s cycle — Mathias will welcome her prayers.
>     - **Snicket:** He will treat her with kindness, seeing her scars as proof of survival.
