# Evelyn DeVoss

## Playing Character

Former commander of the Knights of the Stone Serpent, presumed dead in the battle against Bolgin. Now serves as Fanewraith's top officer and public face in Alula, appearing masked as "The Mask" or "The Wraith's Hand." Tall, battle-hardened human with controlled charisma and icy conviction. Wears a stylized mask (owl-and-thorn motifs) and reinforced armor mixing Stone Serpent gear with wild-grown plates.

- Roleplay notes: Controlled, charismatic, icy conviction. Believes Haven must be broken and traitors must die. Genuinely believes the wild will survive only if someone is ruthless enough to cut out rot. Haunted by Bolgin and by Sabriel's memory; sees herself as finishing the job his order failed to complete.
- Signature line: "The wild reclaims all—will you feed it, or let it devour you?"

## History / Info

Evelyn DeVoss was once a respected leader in the Knights of the Stone Serpent, commanding Sabriel and others in the fight against corruption and threats to Fanewick. She was believed dead when Bolgin, Bringer of the Black Marsh, was burned—a battle that shattered the order and left many presumed lost.

In truth, Evelyn survived but was transformed by the experience. The failure of the Stone Serpent order to prevent Haven's invasion and the loss of so many under her command radicalized her. She came to believe that traditional methods of protection had failed, and that only extreme measures could save Fanewick.

She found her way to Fanewraith's cause, seeing in the rebel leader a kindred spirit—someone willing to do what was necessary, no matter the cost. Fanewraith recognized her military expertise and strategic mind, placing her in charge of Alula's operations as the public face of the rebellion.

In Alula, Evelyn appears masked, rarely revealing her name or identity. Most believe she *is* Fanewraith or an avatar; in truth, Fanewraith is elsewhere, and Evelyn has been left in charge of the city's militant operations.

**Key Events:**
- Commanded Knights of the Stone Serpent before Bolgin
- Presumed dead in battle against Bolgin
- Survived and radicalized by the experience
- Joined Fanewraith's cause
- Placed in charge of Alula operations
- Oversees public executions and rebel control

**Secrets:**
- Her true identity is hidden behind the mask
- She is Sabriel's former commander
- She knows Sabriel's history and regrets
- She uses this knowledge to test and challenge him
- Fanewraith's true location is elsewhere (secret)
- She operates from hidden base in Shadowreach (Location 6C)

## What They Want

- **Short-Term:** Maintain control of Alula, execute "traitors" like Theodore, demonstrate rebel power through public executions, identify and eliminate Haven sympathizers
- **Mid-Term:** Break Haven's hold on Fanewick, force negotiations through extreme measures, prove that ruthlessness is necessary for survival
- **Long-Term:** Restore Fanewick's independence, ensure the wild survives, finish what the Stone Serpent order failed to accomplish
- **Hidden Agenda:** Prove that her methods were right, that the order's failure justified her radicalization, confront Sabriel about their shared past and divergent paths

## What They Know

- **About Sabriel:** His history as her former subordinate, his regrets about the invasion, his atonement journey, his connection to the Stone Serpent order
- **About Theodore:** His capture, his "crimes" (questioning Fanewraith, seeking balance), his connection to Fianna, his scheduled execution
- **About Fanewraith:** The true leader's location (elsewhere), the broader rebel network, plans for the Sowing Eye, strategic operations
- **About Alula:** Complete control structure, spy network, rebel operations, security details, council dynamics, Elder Corin's allegiance
- **About the Execution:** Plans, timing, security, purpose (intimidation and control), potential interference points
- **About the Party:** Their arrival, their goals (likely), their connections to Theodore and Fianna, their potential threat

**Hooks to PCs:**
- **Sabriel:** Recognizes him; may taunt about Bolgin, the invasion, and his atonement. Tests him with moral choices about duty vs. atonement.
- **Fianna:** Knows about her connection to Theodore, may use this to manipulate or test her devotion to balance vs. vengeance
- **Fern:** May appeal to her hedge magic and grove corruption, offering corrupted solutions
- **Gnirth:** Intrigued by his elemental nature and amnesia, may see him as potential weapon or ally
- **Snicket:** Values her smuggling skills, may try to recruit or eliminate her as threat

## Relations

- **To Sabriel:** Former commander, now enemy. Sees him as failed student who chose wrong path. Tests him with moral dilemmas. Personal connection creates emotional stakes.
- **To Fanewraith:** Loyal subordinate, trusted with Alula operations. Believes in Fanewraith's cause and methods. Operates as public face while Fanewraith is elsewhere.
- **To Elder Council:** Resents their traditional authority, works around them through Elder Corin. Views them as weak and ineffective.
- **To Guard-Captain Lirael:** Forced to coordinate but resents being outranked. Tension between traditional guard and rebel control.
- **To Theodore:** Sees as traitor and threat. Plans execution to demonstrate control and eliminate opposition.
- **To PCs:** Potential recruits if Wickling-aligned, enemies if Haven-aligned, tests if neutral. Sabriel connection creates personal stakes.

## Appearance

Tall, battle-hardened human woman with a scar along her jawline (from Bolgin battle). When masked, only her eyes are visible—burning with conviction and haunted by past failures. Wears reinforced armor that mixes the formal gear of the Stone Serpent order with wild-grown plates and thorn decorations. Moves with military precision and controlled intensity.

The mask itself is a work of art and intimidation: stylized owl features (honoring Nikta) combined with thorn motifs (representing the wild's vengeance). It never comes off in public, and only trusted rebels have seen her face.
