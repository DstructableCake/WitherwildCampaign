# Elder Kaelen

## Playing Character

Elder Kaelen is a traditionalist Faun Wildborne who serves on Alula's Elder Council. Older faun with weathered features, traditional Wildborne clothing, antlers wrapped with natural fibers. Stubborn, principled, deeply connected to natural rhythms, opposes radical change and Evelyn's extreme methods.

- Roleplay notes: Stubborn, principled, deeply connected to natural rhythms, opposes radical change. Voice of traditional Wildborne values. Openly opposes Evelyn's methods and public executions. Believes in balance and traditional ways.
- Signature line: "The wild has its own time, its own rhythm. Force it, and you break what you seek to save."

## History / Info

Elder Kaelen has served on Alula's Elder Council for decades, representing traditional Wildborne values and the old ways of living in harmony with nature. He has watched the city transform from a neutral sanctuary into a rebel stronghold, and he deeply opposes the radicalization that has taken hold since the Thorngrowth Incident.

He believes that Theodore is not a true traitor—that the halfling bard was seeking balance, not betrayal. Kaelen sees the execution as a perversion of justice and a sign that the city has lost its way. He often frequents the Rope Bridge Market (Tree 2B), where he can be found speaking with traders and common folk, trying to maintain connections to the traditional ways.

## Appearance

Older faun with weathered features that speak of decades spent in the treetops and forests. His antlers are wrapped with natural fibers—moss, vines, and carefully preserved plant materials—decorated with small tokens and charms that mark significant moments in his long life. His traditional Wildborne clothing is practical but ceremonial, showing his position while maintaining connection to nature.

His eyes hold the weight of years and the sadness of watching his city change. He moves with the deliberate pace of someone who has learned to read the rhythms of nature and people. His voice carries authority but also weariness—someone who has fought many battles for tradition and is tired but not defeated.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of an elderly faun man in a fantasy forest setting. He is a traditional leader and council member in a treetop city. Physical description: weathered face with deep lines showing decades of experience, kind but tired eyes that have seen much change, prominent antlers wrapped with natural fibers (moss, vines, small plant materials) decorated with small tokens and charms. He wears traditional Wildborne clothing—practical but ceremonial robes in earth tones (browns, greens, natural colors) that show his position while maintaining connection to nature. The clothing is well-worn but carefully maintained. He carries a wooden staff carved from ancient wood, and has a herb pouch at his belt. His build is lean but strong, showing someone who has spent a lifetime in the treetops. The setting should be a natural, forested environment with dappled sunlight filtering through leaves, suggesting a treetop platform or forest clearing. The atmosphere should convey wisdom, tradition, and a connection to nature, but also a sense of weariness from fighting for traditional values. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with natural lighting and rich textures showing the weathered wood, natural fibers, and organic materials.
