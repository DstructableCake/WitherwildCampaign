## Playing Fanewraith
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Fanewraith (she/her) is a scarred revolutionary—voice low and fervent, like rustling thorns through fog. Roleplay her as intense and testing, using metaphors of growth/decay to probe loyalties and expose weaknesses.
> 
> Stand out: Ash-white war paint streaks her face, and she wears a bramble crown (a Wither artifact that whispers faintly, potentially triggering Fear Die rolls for nearby listeners).
> 
> In scenes, she's elusive, emerging from shadows for ambushes or parleys—perfect for moral dilemmas (e.g., "Join the bloom, or be strangled by it?"). Voice line: "The wild reclaims all—will you feed it, or let it devour you?" For your party, Fanewraith might tempt Fianna with vengeance against Haven while offering Fern a "corrupted cure" for her grove, tying into themes of transformation and grief. 
> 
> Use her to create party splits: e.g., appeal to Gnirth's elemental urges with promises of "watery rebirth," but challenge Sabriel's regrets by forcing a choice between duty and atonement.

## History/Info
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Fanewraith (she/her, ~40s human, real name Elara Voss) is a slyborne insurgent leader from Stolen Fen, once a humble farmer who traded knowledge with loreborne hunters in the bogs. 
> 
> The Haven invasion displaced her family, and the ensuing Witherwild overgrowth strangled her loved ones (1 year ago), igniting her rage. She formed rebel cells, embracing the corruption as Nikta's "righteous wrath," and now seeks the Sowing Eye to plunge Fanewick into eternal winter, starving out invaders. Her real name (Elara Voss) is a closely guarded secret, shared only with trusted allies like Rina Bog. 
> 
> Subplot: Her bramble crown is a Hyacynis artifact, slowly corrupting her—leading to a potential redemption arc if PCs uncover her lost child's shrine and appeal to her grief.Key Events:
> 
> - "Family lost to Witherwild vines after invasion displacement (1 year ago)."
> - "Formed insurgent cells, allying with disillusioned Wardens (6 months ago)."
> - "Discovered partial weft-access ritual from a captured Haven spy (recently)."
> 
> Secrets:
> 
> - "Maintains a hidden shrine to her lost child in Low Passage, where she performs private rituals (vulnerable spot for infiltration)."
> - "Her bramble crown grants Wither control but inflicts personal tokens, risking full corruption."
> - "Has a secret pact with [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms|Hyacynis]] for bloom weapons, but fears the god's growing influence."
> - "Knows a backdoor to [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]'s weft but requires a blood sacrifice (could tie to Gnirth's rituals)."
> 
> Current Situation: Fanewraith rotates between safehouses ([[Alula]] treetops, [[Low Passage]] tunnels, God’s Nest fringes), evading [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]]'s spies while planning [[Sowing Eye]] theft. 
> 
> She's recently contacted Fern via Fungril network whispers, offering alliance against the corruption plaguing her grove, but distrusts [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] as a "stone-hearted invader." If the party approaches, she tests them with a sabotage mission in [[Stolen Fen]], observing from shadows.
> 
> Appearance: General: Lean and tough, with a wiry frame honed by guerrilla life; moves like a vine snaking through undergrowth. Distinguishing Features:
> 
> - "Ash-white war paint in thorny patterns across her face, symbolizing Wither scars."
> - "Eyes burning with sleepless conviction, glowing faintly in low light (from crown attunement)."Items:
> - "Bramble crown (Wither artifact: whispers intel, can summon minor vines)."
> - "Bog-woven cloak (camouflage in corrupted areas; hides small daggers and rebel codes)."
> 
> Personality: Quiet intensity with a revolutionary fire; motivated by vengeful survival—sees herself as Fanewick's thorny savior. Quirk: Twists a vine ring when plotting, which sometimes sprouts involuntarily (Wither token hint); speaks in plant metaphors, e.g., "Haven is the weed—we are the root."

## What They Want
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Short-Term:** Steal the [[Sowing Eye]] from [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]] to force eternal winter and starve Haven; sabotage key farms like Stolen Fen to disrupt veil production. Views the party as potential recruits if Wickling-aligned (e.g., tests Fern with a grove-ritual sabotage). (GM Tip: Offer corrupted boons like temporary Wither resistance during negotiations, but tie to token risks for tension.)
>   
> - **Long-Term:** Expel Haven completely, restoring Fanewick's natural cycles through any means (even famine or mass transformation). Open to uneasy alliances with anti-Haven PCs like Fianna or Gnirth, but demands proof of loyalty (e.g., betraying Sabriel). (Hook: If the party aids a raid, Fanewraith reveals a weft path to Nikta, but only after a blood oath.)
>   
> - **Hidden Agenda:** Fully harness the [[WitherWild]] as a living weapon, potentially corrupting allies like [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms|Hyacynis]] or Mira's research for "evolutionary" power. If opposed, she frames the party as Haven spies (Sabriel hook) or unleashes targeted corruption on their backstories (e.g., accelerating Fern's grove decay). Subplot: Her agenda risks alienating moderate rebels, creating an internal faction split PCs can exploit. (Lever: Appeal to her lost child for a redemption path, reducing her aggression if successful on a high Presence roll.)

## What They Know
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Fanewraith's insurgent network spans Fanewick—uses Wither vines for "whispers" and scouts for intel. (GM Tip: Roll Instinct for revelations; tie to Wither tokens—if PCs interrogate her, they risk gaining one from "vine feedback," adding tension to encounters.)
> 
> - **About Fanewraith:** (Self-knowledge: Her own plans for the Sowing Eye, including a ritual site near God's Nest; views herself as a necessary martyr, but hides doubts about winter's famine cost.)
>   
> - **About Witherwild/Sickness:** Full patterns of overgrowth and how to weaponize it (e.g., accelerating corruption in targeted areas like Fern's grove); knows Sickness as "Shun’Aush's revenge" and veil cures as Haven's "stolen bloom." (Hints at Snicket's scars: "Dust twists the small ones first—join us to twist back.")
>   
> - **Pc Specific:**
>     - "[[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] Fungril: Knows her corrupted grove and eclipse birth via Fungril whispers; sees as a 'bloom ally' for hedge magic against Haven ('Your midnight spores could choke their fields')."
>     - "[[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]] Nikta: Respects her devotion and Kin's vengeance faction; offers to 'cure' Brindle through a Wither ritual ('Nikta's wrath mends her faithful—join the thorned path')."
>     - "[[Gnirth]] Fungril: Intrigued by his amnesia and water urges; believes it's a 'weft void' and offers ritual answers ('Water flows to the wild's heart—drown Haven with me')."
>     - "[[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] Haven Knight: Knows his invasion regrets and Stone Serpent order; tests with moral choices ('Your blade cut our roots—now cut stone, or be pruned')."
>     - "[[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]] Goblin: Values her smuggling and Sickness scars as 'shadow resilience'; recruits for espionage ('Your chains link our thorns—smuggle death to Haven')."
> - **General PC Info:** Perceives Wickling PCs (Fern, Fianna, Gnirth) as natural allies against "stone oppressors," but distrusts Haven-tied ones (Sabriel, Snicket) as potential spies; knows general backstories via rebel scouts (e.g., "The knight's fallen town? Our wild's gift").

%%
## Relations
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **To PCs:** Intense recruiter—rewards loyalty with Wither artifacts (e.g., token-resistant vines), punishes betrayal with targeted ambushes or corruption (e.g., accelerating Brindle's taint for Fianna). Fern: Kin in bloom. Fianna: Fellow devotee. Gnirth: Elemental comrade. Sabriel: Potential convert through regret. Snicket: Shadow operative. (GM Tip: Use to create party tension—offer Fern a grove-cure but demand Sabriel's betrayal, forcing a vote or split.)
>   
> - **To Key NPCs:** [[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]] (arch enemy—wants dead for Eye theft: "The magus sowed this storm"). [[Kreil Durn|Kreil]] (clever foe—targets his network with sabotage: "Spies wither in thorns"). Elara (rival for Nikta's favor—shares name root ironically, but competes for Warden loyalty: "She preaches balance; I wield it").
>   
> - **Factions:**
>     - "Allies: Fanewraith's Insurgents (leads them), [[Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms|Hyacynis]] (pact for blooms), disillusioned Wardens (recruits for vengeance)."
>     - "Enemies: Haven Vanguard (primary targets), moderate Wicklings (sees as weak), Withered Covenant (rivals for corruption control)."
>     - "Stance: Fanewick purist—embraces Witherwild as 'nature's justice' against Haven's exploitation; open to Wickling alliances but scorns Haven 'stone-hearts' like [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]."

## Stat Block
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Fanewraith is a Tier 3 Elite (insurgent leader with Wither manipulation). (GM Tip: Use for ambushes or moral confrontations; her crown can inflict Wither tokens on failed saves, tying to party mechanics like Fern's hedge witchcraft or Gnirth's elemental surges—escalate if PCs gain too many, forcing a "corruption test" subplot.)
> 
> - **Core Stats:** Agility 18, Finesse 16, Instinct 14, Knowledge 14, Presence 14, Strength 10. HP: {"max": 50, "thresholds": [40, 25, 10]}. Armor: 1 (bog cloak). Evasion: 16.
> - **Skills:** {"Stealth": "Expert", "Survival": "Expert", "Nature": "Proficient", "Deception": "Proficient", "Intimidation": "Proficient"}. (Advantage on Wither-related rolls or in corrupted terrain.)
> - **Saves:** {"Agility": "+8", "Instinct": "+6"}. (Resistance to plant/poison from crown; advantage vs. scrying due to Wither camouflage.)
> - **Resistances:** ["Plant-based effects", "Poison (crown attunement)", "Fear Die from corruption sources (once per scene)"].
> - **Vulnerabilities:** ["Mentions of lost family (disadvantage on Presence saves, triggering emotional outburst)", "Direct sunlight (crown weakens, lose resistance and take 1d4 radiant damage per turn)", "Moral appeals to innocents (Instinct rolls at advantage, potentially halting an attack)"].
> - **Abilities:**
>     - {"name": "Wither Crown", "description": "Action: Summon entangling vines in a 20-ft radius (targets must succeed on Agility save or take 1d6 piercing + inflict 1 Wither token; failed save also restrains for 1 turn). Ties to party: Can target corrupted areas like Fern's grove for amplified effect (+1d6 damage)."}
>     - {"name": "Insurgent Command", "description": "Bonus Action: Grant an ally advantage on their next Stealth or attack roll; if targeting a PC like Snicket, add a narrative whisper ('The shadows bloom for you')."}
>     - {"name": "Thorned Ambush", "description": "Reaction (after moving unseen): Melee attack with surprise (1d8 + Finesse modifier piercing; on hit, inflict Fear Die roll). Subplot tie: If used on Sabriel, mock his regrets ('Your stone blade withers')."}
>     - {"name": "Weft Whisper", "description": "Free Action (once per short rest): Sense hidden foes or weaknesses within 30 ft (reveal one PC secret or vulnerability, e.g., Gnirth's amnesia). Can trigger a minor weft vision for plot advancement."}
> - **Plot Hooks (integrated with motivations):**
>     - "Fanewraith ambushes the party in Low Passage, testing their loyalty with a choice: join a sabotage raid on Stolen Fen or face Wither vines (short-term motivation tie; hooks Sabriel's regrets)."
>     - "Contacts Fern via Fungril network, offering a 'corrupted cure' for her grove in exchange for hedge magic aid in a ritual (long-term cycle restoration; subplot: risks further corruption)."
>     - "Reveals her hidden shrine to Fianna during a parley, proposing an alliance to heal Brindle but demanding vengeance on a Haven target (hidden agenda: harness Nikta's power; lever for party moral dilemma)."
