## Appearance

Elven scholar with the focused, intellectual bearing of someone who has spent decades among books and scrolls. His face shows the weight of knowledge and the conflict of someone who knows many secrets but is torn about what to share. His eyes hold the depth of someone who has read much and learned to see patterns in history.

He dresses in scholarly robes that mark his position as archive keeper—practical but showing his role, perhaps with ink stains or the wear of someone who handles old documents. His movements are deliberate and careful, reflecting his work with delicate materials and his need to preserve knowledge.

His bearing is scholarly but conflicted, the kind of person who values truth but understands that not all truths should be revealed. He carries himself with the weight of someone who knows that knowledge is power, and that power must be wielded carefully.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a scholarly, middle-aged to elderly elven archive keeper in a fantasy library setting. He is an archive keeper in a treetop city who knows many secrets. Physical description: focused, intellectual bearing showing someone who has spent decades among books, middle-aged to elderly (appears 40s-60s in human terms), elven features (pointed ears, graceful build), face showing the weight of knowledge and conflict, eyes that hold the depth of someone who has read much. He wears scholarly robes in academic colors (deep blues, rich browns, or dark greens) that mark his position as archive keeper—perhaps with ink stains or the wear of someone who handles old documents. The robes should be practical but show his role. He should be in a vast library or archive setting with towering shelves of ancient tomes, scrolls cascading from ceiling hooks, maps pinned to walls, soft glow from reading lamps, and the atmosphere of accumulated knowledge. The setting should convey a place of learning, secrets, and preserved history. The atmosphere should convey wisdom, conflict, and the careful handling of knowledge. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with warm library lighting that creates a sense of accumulated knowledge, showing the textures of old books, scrolls, and the conflicted expression of someone who knows many secrets but is torn about what to share.
