## History / Info

Elowen is the real person whose identity Fanewraith (Elara Voss) used as a disguise when meeting the party in Session 6. She is related to Elara—likely her mother, aunt, or older sister—and remembers what Elara was like before she became Fanewraith.

She has chosen to remain neutral and separate from the conflict, living in a secluded hovel near Alula where she tends a small garden and lives in peace with her companion Demetrius, a mole.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of an elderly, kind human woman in a fantasy forest setting. She is a healer and lorekeeper who lives in a secluded hovel near a treetop city. Physical description: elderly (70s-80s), kind eyes showing the weight of years and sadness of loss but also gentleness, weathered hands from a lifetime of work and care, face marked by age but showing strength and peace. She wears simple, practical clothing in earth tones (browns, tans, natural colors)—well-worn but cared for, showing someone who values function and comfort. The clothing should be practical and comfortable. She should be in a peaceful, secluded setting—a small hovel or cottage surrounded by a garden with night blooms and healing herbs, protective herbs and subtle wards, natural forest environment, and the atmosphere of someone who has chosen peace. A mole companion (Demetrius) should be visible nearby. The setting should convey peace, seclusion, and a connection to nature. The atmosphere should convey kindness, wisdom, grief, and the quiet dignity of someone who has chosen their path. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with soft, warm lighting that creates a sense of peace and safety, showing the textures of her simple clothing, the garden, and the gentle expression of someone who provides healing and perspective.
