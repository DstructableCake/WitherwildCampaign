![[Captain Thorne Portrait.png|400]]

## Playing Captain Thorne 

Captain Thorne (he/him) is a seasoned Haven military veteran turned settlement security chief — voice low, clipped, with the weight of years in every word. 
%%
> [!NOTE]
> 
> Roleplay him as pragmatic and protective, with a soldier’s habit of scanning every crowd for trouble. 
> 

%%
Stand out: Broad-shouldered, weathered face, short-cropped grey hair, faded Haven military coat with insignia removed, a steel badge pinned to his chest. 
%%

> [!NOTE]
> In scenes, he’s direct but not unkind, often giving orders in the form of suggestions. He respects competence and loyalty, but distrusts outsiders until they’ve proven themselves. 

%%
Voice line: _“Quiet’s good… until it isn’t.”_ 

For your party, Thorne is Sabriel’s old comrade and a potential ally in Stolen Fen — a source of local intel, small jobs and information.

## History/Info

Captain Thorne served in the Haven border campaigns during the early years of the Fanewick conflict, commanding a small unit tasked with securing agricultural outposts. 

After the war, he retired from active duty but was recruited to oversee security in **[[Stolen Fen]]**, a settlement critical to Haven’s white flower harvest. He’s seen enough loss to value stability above all else, and he runs the settlement’s defenses with quiet efficiency. 

Though loyal to Haven, he’s pragmatic — willing to bend rules if it keeps his people safe.
