## Appearance

Elven information broker with the sharp, calculating eyes of someone who makes their living by knowing secrets. Their face is intelligent and observant, with a bearing that suggests they are always assessing, always gathering information. They move with the quiet efficiency of someone who knows how to be unobtrusive while remaining aware of everything around them.

They dress in practical but unremarkable clothing that allows them to blend into the city's population—nothing that would draw attention, but nothing that would mark them as particularly important. Their establishment is organized but cluttered with the tools of their trade—scrolls, notes, coded messages, and the various materials needed for information gathering.

Their voice is measured and careful, used to sharing information in ways that maintain plausible deniability. They can make complex information seem clear while leaving room for interpretation, making them an effective information broker who can serve multiple masters.

**LLM Portrait Generation Prompt:**

Create a detailed, realistic portrait of a cunning, middle-aged elven information broker in a fantasy setting. They are an information broker in a treetop city who operates as a rebel front. Physical description: intelligent, observant face with sharp, calculating eyes that suggest someone who makes their living by knowing secrets, middle-aged (appears 30s-40s in human terms), elven features (pointed ears, graceful build), bearing that suggests they are always assessing and gathering information. They wear practical but unremarkable clothing in neutral colors (grays, browns, muted tones) that allows them to blend into the population—nothing that draws attention but functional and well-maintained. They should be in an information broker's establishment with scrolls, notes, coded messages, writing materials, and organized but cluttered workspace visible. The setting should convey a place of secrets and information—shelves with scrolls, coded messages, maps, and the tools of information gathering. The atmosphere should convey intelligence, cunning, and the careful handling of secrets. The style should be realistic fantasy art, detailed and atmospheric, with soft, focused lighting that creates a sense of a place where information is gathered and secrets are kept, showing the textures of scrolls, papers, and the careful expression of someone who deals in knowledge.
