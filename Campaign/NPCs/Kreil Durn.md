![[Kreil Durn Portrait.png|400]]

%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Officially:** Haven’s spymaster, loyal to Phylax and the High Magus’ agenda.
> - **Privately:** He sees Phylax’s hubris and the Witherwild fallout as dangerous. He’s trying to **quietly counterbalance**Haven’s mistakes without being branded a traitor.
> - **The Fanewraith (Elara Voss):**
>     - Kreil knows she intends to steal **Nikta’s other Eye**.
>     - He doesn’t know when or how, but he knows she’s building power in **Alula**.
>     - He sees her as the **first thread to pull** if the PCs want to stop the Eye theft and maybe find Nikta.
> - **Constraints:**
>     - He cannot openly support the PCs — Phylax would see it as treason.
>     - If discovered, Haven’s elites will deny all knowledge.
>     - He can only help through **deniable assets** (smugglers, coded messages, safehouses).

## Playing Kreil
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Kreil Dirn (he/him) is a weary spymaster—voice gravelly and dry, laced with sarcasm, like a blade dulled by overuse. Roleplay him as competent but cynical, offering grim bargains while fidgeting with a coded coin.
> 
> Stand out: Gaunt frame, ash-gray stubble, ink-stained fingers, and a cane hiding a blade—eyes sharp but shadowed by exhaustion.
> 
> In scenes, he's shadowy and indirect, revealing intel in riddles or trades—perfect for intrigue sessions or moral tests (e.g., "Choose: the Eye or your secrets?"). Voice line: "Shadows hide truths, but they also cut—pick your blade wisely." For your party, Kreil might ally with Snicket's smuggling while pressuring Sabriel's knightly regrets.

%%
## History/Info

Kreil Dirn (he/him, ~50s human) is Haven’s Spymaster, a former field agent who rose by rooting out internal threats. 

%%

> [!INFO]
> He quietly opposed the Eye theft, seeing it as hubris, but enforced it out of duty. Now, with the Sickness claiming his family, he works to stop [[Fanewraith]] while questioning Haven's path. 
> 
> Secrets: Hides early Sickness; protects a network of defectors (including possible ties to [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]]'s old order); has blackmail on [[Hale]]. 
> 
> Plot hook: Contacts [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]] via smuggling channels for a border meet, offering cure intel if she spies on [[Fanewraith]]; for [[Gnirth]], probes his amnesia as a "elemental anomaly."

%%

Appearance: Gaunt, layered travel cloak, functional cane, ink-stained fingers from endless reports.
%%
> [!INFO]
> Personality: Tired competence with dry humor. Motivated by redemption—fears becoming a statue like his loved ones. 
> Quirk: Spins a coin when thinking, stopping abruptly to deliver bad news; coughs subtly when mentioning Sickness, hinting at his own affliction.
%%
## What They Want
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> - **Short-Term:** Stop [[Fanewraith]]'s [[Sowing Eye]] theft; use PCs as deniable assets (e.g., send to [[Alula]]). Prevent [[Haven]]'s collapse by exposing internal corruption. (GM Tip: Offer intel bribes, like maps or safe houses; for [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]], promise dust-proof gear.)
>   
> - **Long-Term:** Broker a fragile peace or controlled withdrawal from [[Fanewick]], saving Haven without total war. (Hook: If [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] pushes atonement, Kreil arranges a secret summit with Wardens, involving [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]]'s [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]] ties.)
>   
> - **Hidden Agenda:** Build a defector network for post-plague Haven; uses PCs to smuggle cures (ties to [[Mira Voss|Mira]] Veilweaver—might task Fern/Gnirth with Fungril network delivery). If betrayed, leaks PC secrets to [[Archmage Phylax|Phylax]]. (Lever: If Gnirth's urges surface, Kreil offers "elemental suppressants" for loyalty.)

%%
## What They Know
DM
%%

> [!INFO]
> Kreil's intel network is unmatched—uses spies and scrying for leverage. (GM Tip: Roll Investigation for revelations; tie to Fear Die if PCs push for sensitive info, risking exposure or token gain from "dusty secrets.")
> 
> 
> - On [[Fanewraith]]: Her real name ([[Fanewraith|Elara Voss]]), current hideouts (Low Passage, God’s Nest), and plot timeline—sees as a mirror of Haven's mistakes. (Details: Suspects ties to [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]]'s Kin division.)
> - On Witherwild/Sickness: Spread patterns, quarantine failures; knows dust ties to [[Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid|Shun'Aush]] and how it affects goblins/Fungril (hints at [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]]'s ears/Fern's grove: "Corruption spreads like spores").
> - On PCs:
> 	- [[Fern Wingsteria|Fern]] (Fungril Hedge Witch): Knows her corrupted grove via scouts; recruits for network ("Your blooms whisper secrets—share them").
> 	- [[Fianna Fernwhisperer|Fianna]] (Nikta Worshiper): Tracks her Kin's divide; offers Brindle cure intel ("Your fox's taint? I know a way—if you spy").
> 	- [[Gnirth]] (Fungril Sorcerer): Intrigued by amnesia/urges; offers leads ("Water voids? My network fills them—for a price").
> 	- [[Sabriel Arden|Sabriel]] (Haven Knight): Knows invasion regrets; pressures loyalty ("Your fallen unit? Avenge them with me").
> 	- [[Snicket Surefoot|Snicket]] (Goblin Rogue): Knows smuggling/Sickness scars; blackmails/allies ("Your chains? I can break them—if you deliver").
> - PC Knowledge: Weaknesses via informants (e.g., "Fern's eclipse birth? A divine flaw"; "Gnirth's rituals? Elemental bait").
