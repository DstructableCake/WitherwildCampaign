## Playing Bolgin

Bolgin is a vengeful bog spirit—voice a deep, gurgling rumble, like mud bubbling with suppressed rage. 
%%
> [!NOTE]
> Roleplay it as ancient and territorial, speaking in riddles of decay and renewal, with a whimsical lilt that turns horrifying.

%%
Stand out: A colossal, amorphous mass of black marsh mud, vines, and glowing fungal eyes; tendrils form temporary "faces" that whisper taunts.

%%
> [!NOTE]
> In scenes, it's elusive and environmental, manifesting as sinking bogs or vine ambushes - perfect for suspenseful horror (e.g., "The marsh remembers your fire... now it claims you."). 

> [!NOTE]
> Voice line: "You burned my roots, but roots regrow—deeper, darker, devouring." Use to build awe/terror: Bolgin "plays" with prey (whimsical mud illusions) before striking (human cost: drowns victims in petrifying sludge).

## History/Info

Bolgin, Bringer of the Black Marsh (it/they, ancient Faint Divinity) is a bog guardian embodying decay and renewal - once a neutral force nurturing Fanewick's wetlands, providing fertile soil and hidden refuges for Wicklings. 

During Haven's invasion (1 year ago), Sabriel's Knights "burned" it to clear bogs for farms - a D-Day-level assault that seemingly destroyed it. 
%%
> [!NOTE]
> Twist: Bolgin wasn't killed; the fire banished it to a weakened state in [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]'s weft, where it festered, absorbing imbalance energy (perpetual spring amplified its rot). Now regenerating, it seeks revenge on "disruptors" (Haven invaders, Wickling collaborators), allying with opportunistic forces like [[Dustveil]] for "marsh equality." Secrets: Its "death" created a weft rift leaking hybrids; it whispers to Thring's void (elemental chaos tie); can possess bog creatures for subtle influence.

%%
Key Events:

- "Guarded Fanewick bogs pre-invasion, nurturing life/death cycle."
- "Burned/banished by Knights during invasion (1 year ago)."
%%
> [!NOTE]
> - "Regenerates in weft, twisted by imbalance (recently)."

> [!NOTE]
> Current Situation: Bolgin lurks in eastern bogs (near Rot Hollow), manifesting outbreaks to test/test revenge. It senses the party's imbalance (e.g., Sabriel's regrets) and targets them subtly, building to a mid/late-game return.Appearance: General: Colossal mud/vine mass with fungal glow. 

%%
Distinguishing Features:

- Glowing eyes in mud "faces."
- Tendrils that form whispering mouths.

## What They Want
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - **Short-Term:** Harass "disruptors" (e.g., Haven patrols, Wickling farmers) with bog ambushes/outbreaks. Test the party (Sabriel especially) to gauge worthiness. (GM Tip: Use manifestations as environmental hazards, offering riddles for safe passage.)
> - **Long-Term:** Fully return to mortal plane by absorbing enough "imbalance energy" (e.g., from Witherwild/Sickness sites). Reclaim bogs, drowning invaders in "renewed marsh." (Hook: Allies with Dustveil for mutual "equality," merging B Plot.)
> - **Hidden Agenda:** Corrupt Nikta's weft-rift to create a "black marsh realm" (eternal decay domain). If opposed, possesses a PC (e.g., Thring's void) for infiltration. (Lever: Can be "appeased" with tributes proving respect for balance, reducing aggression.)

%%
## What They Know
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> Bolgin's knowledge is primal and environmental—senses through bogs/weft, knowing hidden paths and corruptions. (GM Tip: Roll Instinct for revelations; its "whispers" can grant clues but inflict Fear Die.)
> 
> - **On Fanewraith:** Views her as a "thorny ally" in chaos—knows her Sowing Eye plan but sees it as "imbalanced fire."
> - **On Witherwild/Sickness:** Knows as "twin curses" from invasion—can sense outbreaks (hints at Fern: "Your grove drowns in stolen spring").
> - **On PCs:**
>     - Fern: Senses her eclipse birth as "weft-touched"; offers bog secrets for alliance.
>     - Fianna: Respects Nikta tie but mocks "feather balance" as weak.
>     - Thring: Knows his void as "chaos kin"; whispers urges to amplify them.
>     - Sabriel: Remembers him as "fire-bringer"; targets for personal revenge.
>     - Snicket: Views scars as "dust gift"; offers smuggling paths through bogs.
> - **PC Knowledge:** Senses weaknesses via mud/whispers (e.g., "Sabriel's fire regrets burn deep").
