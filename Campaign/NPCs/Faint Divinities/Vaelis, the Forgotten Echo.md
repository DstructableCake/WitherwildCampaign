## Appearance

- Appears as a figure made of mist and half-remembered shapes
- Face is never clear—features shift like memories trying to form
- Carries a mirror that shows reflections of things that were, not things that are
- Emerges from places of loss, forgotten ruins, or where memories linger

## Roleplay
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Melancholic keeper of lost memories and forgotten things
> - Plays as a gentle archivist, speaking in echoes and fragments
> - Uses a voice like distant whispers: "What was... can be remembered... if the price is paid."
> - Helpful but costly—offers to restore memories but demands something be forgotten in return
> - Knows secrets of the past, especially things others want to forget

%%
## Location

- Forgotten ruins and abandoned places
- Sites of tragedy or loss
- Places where memories linger (old battlefields, deserted villages)
- Near [[Tideveil Enclave]] and other drowned or lost settlements
- Throughout [[Fanewick]], especially where the past weighs heavy

## Requirements for Assistance
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Aids recovering lost memories, learning forgotten secrets, or understanding the past
> - Requires "memory tribute"—share a cherished memory to be forgotten, or help preserve a memory that's fading
> - Assists if it maintains balance between remembering and forgetting, but may demand a painful memory be given up
> - May offer to "take" a painful memory away, but at the cost of losing something important

%%
## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Neutral guardian of memory and forgetting
> - [[Witherwild]] corruption that erases or distorts memories angers them—they see it as unnatural forgetting
> - Pro-[[Fanewick]] for preserving oral traditions, but will aid anyone who respects the balance of memory
> - Views amnesia (like Gnirth's) as a wound that needs healing, but healing comes at a price
> - Knows that some things are better forgotten, and some must never be lost

%%

## Campaign Connections
DM
%%
- **Gnirth's Arc:** Vaelis is the perfect divinity to help Gnirth recover his memories of Tideveil, but the price will be steep—perhaps he must forget something else, or share a memory that reveals his guilt.
- **Session 8:** Could appear near the river if Gnirth has a vision, offering to help him remember—for a price.
- **Fern's Grove:** Vaelis might know what Fern's grove was like before corruption, offering to show her—if she's willing to forget something else.
