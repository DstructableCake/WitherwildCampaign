%%

- Briar patches
- Overgrown ruins
- Death sites in [[Fanewick]]

## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Frustrated neutral
> - [[Witherwild]] overburdens them with endless deaths, but they see beauty in its "thorny embrace"
> - Anti-[[Haven]] (plague disrupts natural death); pro-[[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]] for decay's return
