## Appearance

- Appears as a figure made of musical notes and harmonies made visible
- Form shifts with the music they create—sometimes a bard, sometimes a bird, sometimes just a melody
- Carries an instrument that changes shape (lute, flute, drum, or just their voice)
- Emerges from places where music is made, stories are told, or songs are remembered

## Roleplay
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Joyful, creative keeper of songs, stories, and the power of music
> - Plays as a wandering minstrel or master bard, speaking in rhymes and melodies
> - Uses a voice like music itself: "Every story needs a song... every song tells a story."
> - Helpful and generous—loves to share songs and stories, but demands creativity in return
> - Knows the old songs, the forgotten melodies, and the power of music to change hearts

%%
## Location

- Places where music is made (taverns, campfires, festivals)
- Sites of great stories or legends
- Where bards gather or perform
- Throughout [[Fanewick]], especially where stories are told and songs are shared
> - Avoids [[Haven]] (too quiet, too ordered) but may appear at border celebrations

## Requirements for Assistance
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Aids through songs that inspire, stories that reveal truth, or music that heals
> - Requires "song tribute"—perform a song, share a story, or create something new (poem, tale, melody)
> - Assists freely if it spreads joy and creativity, but may demand players learn and share a song
> - May offer a song that reveals a secret, but only if the PC promises to teach it to others

%%
## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Chaotic good advocate of creativity and expression
> - [[Witherwild]]'s silence and corruption frustrates them—they prefer life, music, and stories
> - Pro-[[Fanewick]] for its rich oral traditions and musical culture, but will aid anyone who creates
> - Views eternal spring as "monotonous"—wants the variety that comes with changing seasons
> - Believes stories and songs can change the world, one heart at a time

## Campaign Connections
DM
%%
- **Theodore's Arc:** Sylvan is the perfect divinity for Theodore, a bard. They might have guided him, or he might seek their aid in Alula.
- **Fianna's Quest:** Sylvan might know songs about Nikta, the Eyes, or the old ways—songs that could help Fianna understand what her father was seeking.
- **Session 8:** Could appear at the Riverwalker campfire if someone starts singing or telling stories, offering a song that reveals something about Theodore or Alula.
- **Fern's Grove:** Sylvan might know songs about the grove before corruption, or offer a melody that could help restore it.
