## Appearance

- Squat, troll like figure made of stacking stones

## Roleplay 

DM Only
%%
> [!NOTE]
> - Grumpy, isolationist hermit - curt, literal and obsessed with 'balance' in stacks.
> - Gravelly, echoing voice
> - Respond to questions with riddles about stability 
> 	- "A tower falls without a strong base—what of your quest?"
> - Non-hostile but dismissive of squishy mortals unless offered structure (A well built cairn)
> - Emphasize reluctance; Fulg hates the Witherwild's chaos but wont act without 'proper foundation'
%%
## Location 

- Riverbanks
- Quarries
- Ancient stone circles
- Avoid [[Haven]] (too unstable due to plague) but might lurk near corrupted streams

## Requirements for Assistance 

DM Only
%%
> [!NOTE]
> - Assists with stability - River crossings, earthquake resistance, eg
> - Demands a stacked tribute - building a cairn with a personal item symbolising the PC's foundations 
> - Cost - Mark a [[Stress]] or lose an item.
> - Refusal causes a minor instability (PC's gear crumbles temporarily)
