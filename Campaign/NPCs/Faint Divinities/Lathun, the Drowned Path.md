## Appearance

- Appears as a figure made of flowing water and river mist, constantly shifting
- Face is never fully visible—sometimes a reflection, sometimes a ripple
- Carries a staff of driftwood that drips with clear water
- Emerges from river eddies, fords, or places where water meets land

## Roleplay
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Patient, ancient guide of boundaries and transitions
> - Plays as a wise ferryman or river guardian, speaking in metaphors of flow and change
> - Uses a voice like water over stones: "The river remembers all paths... even those drowned."
> - Helpful but tests resolve—offers passage but demands respect for the boundary between land and water
> - Knows secrets of crossings, hidden fords, and the places where worlds meet

%%
## Location

- River crossings and fords
- Places where water meets land (riverbanks, shores, marshes)
- Hidden paths that follow watercourses
- The Great River and its tributaries throughout [[Fanewick]]
- Avoids [[Haven]] (too many dams and controlled waterways) but appears at natural borders

## Requirements for Assistance
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Aids safe passage across water, finding hidden paths, or revealing secrets of boundaries
> - Requires "water tribute"—offer something that flows (a story, a tear, a drop of blood into the river) or help restore a blocked waterway
> - Assists if it maintains the natural flow of boundaries, but refuses if players try to control or dam the water
> - May demand a secret be shared—something that "flows" from the PC's past

%%
## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Neutral guardian of boundaries and transitions
> - [[Witherwild]] corruption that blocks or poisons waterways angers them—they see it as disrupting the natural flow
> - Pro-[[Fanewick]] for respecting natural boundaries, but will aid [[Haven]] if it means restoring a river's flow
> - Views the theft of Nikta's Eye as disrupting the "flow" of seasons, creating stagnation
> - Knows secrets of Tideveil and other drowned places, but rarely shares them unless the price is right
