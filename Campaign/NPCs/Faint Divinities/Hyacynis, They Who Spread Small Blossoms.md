## Roleplay

DM Only
%%
> [!NOTE]
> - Energetic, opportunistic, and gleeful
> - Plays as a chaotic opportunist revelling in growth
> - Uses a buzzing, multi-voiced speech: "Weeee buzz with deeeelight!"
> - Flirtatious and deal-oriented, but fickle
> - Praises the [[Witherwild]]'s "bloom" while downplaying destruction
> - Roleplays as a merchant of favors: always upsells bargains, twisting words like faerie deals
%%
## Location

- Flower fields
- Meadows
- Corrupted groves in [[Fanewick]] (thriving in eternal spring)
- Avoids [[Haven]] (too barren) but infests border farms

## Requirements for Assistance

DM Only
%%
> [!NOTE]
> - Aids growth (e.g., healing blooms, vine bridges)
> - Requires "pollination"—spread their blossoms (plant seeds) or share "nectar" (a PC's vitality, e.g., mark a Stress for temporary buffs)
> - Assists eagerly if it spreads [[Witherwild]], but demands escalating costs (e.g., infect an ally with minor corruption for major help)

## World View
DM Only
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Pro-[[Witherwild]] enthusiast
> - Eternal spring is a "grand bloom," empowering them
> - Resents [[Haven]]'s farms (stealing "their" flowers)
> - Neutral on [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]—growth trumps balance
> - Would assist players if it means more chaos, but would betray if it curbs the overgrowth
