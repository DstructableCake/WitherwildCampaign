## Appearance

- Appears as a figure made of shadows and secrets, never fully visible
- Form shifts like smoke, sometimes a person, sometimes just a voice
- Face is always hidden—hooded, masked, or turned away
- Emerges from places of secrets, hidden knowledge, or where truth is concealed

## Roleplay
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Cryptic, mysterious keeper of secrets and hidden knowledge
> - Plays as a spy or informant, speaking in riddles and half-truths
> - Uses a voice like a whisper: "Some truths are meant to be hidden... until the right moment."
> - Helpful but dangerous—offers secrets but demands others in return
> - Knows things others want to keep hidden, and trades in information

%%
## Location

- Places of secrets (hidden rooms, spy networks, smuggler dens)
- Where knowledge is concealed (libraries, archives, coded messages)
> - Throughout [[Fanewick]] and [[Haven]], especially where information is power
- Appears to those who seek truth, but only if they're willing to pay

## Requirements for Assistance
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Aids by revealing secrets, uncovering hidden knowledge, or exposing lies
> - Requires "secret tribute"—share a secret of your own, or help conceal another's secret
> - Assists if it maintains the balance of hidden and revealed knowledge, but may demand dangerous information
> - May offer a crucial secret, but only if the PC promises to keep another secret safe

%%
## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - True neutral guardian of secrets and information
> - [[Witherwild]] corruption that hides truth or spreads lies angers them—they see it as unnatural concealment
> - Pro-[[Fanewick]] and [[Haven]] equally—secrets exist everywhere, and truth must be balanced
> - Views the theft of Nikta's Eye as a "hidden truth" that must eventually be revealed
> - Knows that some secrets protect, and some destroy—it's their job to know which is which

## Campaign Connections
DM
%%
- **Snicket's Arc:** Whisper is perfect for a smuggler/rogue. They might know about serpent coins, Veil distribution corruption, or Mr Tilde's network.
- **Fanewraith's Plans:** Whisper might know secrets about Fanewraith's identity, her plans, or where she's hiding—but at what cost?
- **Session 8:** Could appear if Snicket investigates smuggler marks or if the party seeks information about Alula's factions.
- **Fungril Network:** Whisper might know why the network is warped, or have secrets about the Collective that Fern seeks.
