- Carries a massive brush that trails auroras
- Appears in dramatic fashion—descending on a rainbow or as a face in the clouds during sunsets.

## Roleplay
DM Only
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Lazy, sarcastic diva
> - Plays as a prima donna artist, whining about "overtime" (eternal spring means constant painting)
> - Uses a drawling, exasperated tone: "Ugh, another sunset? Mortals are so demanding."
> - Vain and bribe-able with flattery/art, but petty—insult their work, and they "paint" storms

%%
## Location

- High places like mountaintops
- During sunrises/sunsets in [[Fanewick]]/[[Haven]] skies
- Lounges in cloud-palaces, rarely descending unless summoned

## Requirements for Assistance
DM Only
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Helps with sky-magic (e.g., weather control, flight)
> - Demands "inspiration"—create art (e.g., perform a song) or sacrifice beauty (e.g., destroy something pretty, marking a scar)
> - Assistance is half-hearted unless "paid" extravagantly

%%
## World View
DM Only 
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Annoyed neutral
> - Eternal spring means endless "day shifts," exhausting them, but they enjoy the vibrant colors
> - Blames [[Haven]] ("Ugly walls block my canvas") and mocks [[Nikta, the Great Owl|Nikta]]'s plight
> - Would assist for "artistic freedom" (e.g., variable seasons)
