## Appearance

- Appears as a swirling figure of mist and light, constantly in motion
- Form shifts like a whirlpool or eddy, never fully solid
- Voice comes from all directions at once, like echoes on water
- Manifests at river bends, waterfalls, or places where currents change direction

## Roleplay
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Fickle, changeable guide of redirection and second chances
> - Plays as a trickster who offers alternative paths and unexpected solutions
> - Uses a voice that shifts like water: "The current bends... so can you."
> - Helpful but unpredictable—may redirect players to unexpected places or reveal hidden routes
> - Tests adaptability, rewarding those who can "go with the flow" and change plans

%%
## Location

- River bends and curves
- Waterfalls and rapids
- Places where paths fork or diverge
- Hidden shortcuts and alternative routes
- Throughout [[Fanewick]]'s waterways, especially where travelers face choices

## Requirements for Assistance
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Aids finding alternative paths, redirecting plans, or escaping dead ends
> - Requires "change tribute"—abandon a plan, take a different route, or give up something the PC was holding onto
> - Assists if it creates interesting redirections, but may send players on unexpected detours
> - May demand players "bend" their principles slightly—not break them, but adapt

%%
## World View
DM
%%

> [!NOTE]
> - Chaotic neutral advocate of change and adaptation
> - [[Witherwild]]'s stagnation frustrates them—they prefer constant motion and change
> - Pro-[[Fanewick]] for its wild, unpredictable nature, but will aid anyone who embraces change
> - Views eternal spring as "stuck"—wants seasons to flow again, but through natural change, not forced cycles
> - Enjoys watching mortals adapt to unexpected circumstances

## Campaign Connections
DM
%%
- **The Riverwalkers' Hunting Grounds:** Murea appears at key decision points, offering alternative routes that might be faster but more dangerous, or safer but longer.
- **Gnirth's Arc:** Murea might offer him a chance to "bend" his path away from Tideveil's memory, or redirect him toward answers he wasn't seeking.
- **Session 8:** Could appear at the Tainted Ford, offering a "bent" path around it—but at what cost?
