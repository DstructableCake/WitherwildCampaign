# Theodore Underbrush

## Playing Character

Halfling troubadour with a hearth-warm voice and seaside lilt. Youthful-faced (76 years; middle-aged for halflings), taller than most (3.5 ft). Travel-worn leathers, coastal-embroidered cloak, masterwork lute from his family’s famed Seaborne instrument shop. Charismatic first, steel when needed. He disarms with story, then guides with song.

- Roleplay notes: affable, perceptive, gently probing. Plucks a single note when choosing words. Protective when family or balance is invoked.
- Signature line: “A verse can open doors a blade never finds.”

## History / Info

Born Seaborne in a distant coastal city (renowned for fine instruments; parents are master luthiers). Left a wealthy life to walk the world as a troubadour—courts, caravans, and sanctums—collecting songs and secrets. Settled a while at Whitefeather Circle with Fionnula (a faun healer). Taught and learned herb-lore beside her, raised Fianna among Nikta’s boughs.

After Nikta’s maiming and the onset of perpetual spring, Theodore left to seek remedies and justice. He consulted Mathias in Monks Eliegh, then followed Kreil’s lead toward Alula to trace the Fanewraith. Experienced traveler: reads a room, a road, and a rhythm.

## What They Want

- Short-term: Track the Fanewraith (Elara Voss) in/around Alula; learn how to defend Nikta’s remaining Eye.
- Mid-term: Reunite with Fianna; share and expand healing knowledge to help Brindle and others.
- Long-term: Restore balance in Fanewick and return the world’s seasons to right order.
- Quiet oath: Keep his family from the Sickness’ shadow; choose bargains that spare them.

## What They Know

- Nikta’s Eye: The Reaping Eye theft seeded imbalance; shrines and rites in Alula are flashpoints.
- Fanewraith: Grieving, cunning, often two steps ahead; listens where roots remember.
- Healing: Practical herb-lore (yarrow/st. john’s wort for wounds/skin; marigold topical painkiller); can help reconstruct basic health brews with a hedge witch.
- Roads & Rooms: Smuggling cant basics, border etiquette, and how Haven ears are bought.
- Hooks to PCs:
    - Fianna: Confirms, builds on her healing lore; shares hope and technique.
    - Fern: Respects hedge craft; trades stories for rituals.
    - Snicket: Recognizes ledger tricks and “adjusted” shipments.
    - Sabriel: Frames atonement in deeds that shield the meek.
    - Gnirth: Hears the void in water; cautions care when the song pulls under.

## Relations

- Fionnula (faun healer): Partner in life and medicine; a steady moral compass.
- Fianna (daughter): Pride and purpose; he strengthens her peace-first creed.
- Mathias Vanta: Trusts his humility; left with a blessing and a burden.
- Kreil Durn: Pragmatic use—accepts needful secrets to save lives.
- Fanewraith: The task and the test—meets grief with resolve, not hatred.

adversary:
  name: Theodore Underbrush
  tier: 2
  role: Support (Bardic Troubadour)
  difficulty: 13
  thresholds: [7, 13]
  hp: 6
  stress: 4
  armor: 1
  atk: "+2 (Lute-Chord, Close or Near) — 1d6+2 sonic"
  features:
    - name: Bardic Inspiration
      type: Action

    - name: Traveler's Wit
      type: Reaction
      description: "When an ally within Near fails a Presence or Instinct save, Theo plays a sharp counterphrase. They reroll and take the better result."
    - name: Troubadour's Tale
      type: Action
      description: "Share a pertinent story or song. One ally clears 1 Stress and gains advantage on their next social check this scene."
    - name: Encore
      type: Reaction
      description: "When Theo clears at least 1 HP, he may immediately grant Bardic Inspiration without marking Stress."
  xp: 4
```

Tactical summary: Theodore anchors the party’s morale and control of the social field. Opens with Bardic Inspiration, then uses Traveler’s Wit to pad key saves (fear/corruption talk, tense parley). Lute-Chord is a soft control tool; he prefers de-escalation. Under pressure, he spends Stress to bolster multiple allies and retreats to cover allies rather than duel.

Youthful halfling, weather-browned, eyes bright as harbor lights. Cloak bears stitched waves; rings on deft fingers. His laugh is easy; his silences say more.
