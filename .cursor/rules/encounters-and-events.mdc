# Encounters and Events

When outlining encounters, discovery threads, or major events for sessions, design for player agency and Daggerheart tone.

## Multiple Approaches

Every major obstacle or goal should support at least two of: **Social**, **Stealth**, **Combat**, **Information / Investigation**. In session prep, spell out:

- How players can achieve the beat via each approach.
- Which NPCs or locations support each path.
- What "completion" looks like (e.g. "any 2 of 4" so one path isn’t mandatory).

Example: "Learn Theodore's location" via Sergeant Korbin (social/trust), Whispering Leaves (information), infiltration (stealth), or confrontation (combat).

## Discovery Threads

- **One clear discovery per thread** (e.g. Theodore’s location, Brindle’s child, Evelyn’s identity).
- **Where** it can be found (location + NPC or source).
- **How** it can be found (information, social, stealth, item, confrontation).
- **Emotional beat**: Which PC is most affected and a one-line prompt for the GM.
- Cross-thread links: note how threads reinforce each other (e.g. Theodore ↔ Brindle’s child via Fianna).

## Encounters (Combat or Set-Piece)

- **Read-aloud**: Short `> [!QUOTE]` to open the scene.
- **Senses**: Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste (brief).
- **Fear usage**: When to spend Fear and what it does (e.g. enemy vanishes, false clue, paranoia).
- **GM options**: Follow / Confront / Ignore (or equivalent) and consequences.
- **Statblock** (if needed): Use `> [!STATBLOCK]` or a clear block with Health, Armor, Attack, and 1–2 abilities. Keep Daggerheart-appropriate (stress, hope/fear where relevant).

## Pacing and Stakes

- **Checkpoints** should have clear "completion requirements" so the table knows when they’ve advanced.
- **Time pressure** (e.g. execution in 2 days) should be stated in prep and reflected in NPC dialogue and scene beats.
- **Consequences**: Note how success/failure/cliffhanger affects reputation, allies, and next session. Avoid one-shot NPCs for major beats—tie to Campaign/NPCs and ongoing threads.
- **Modular inserts**: Short exploration beats (e.g. serpent coin moment, refugee story, Floating Eye) can pad or trim session time; define trigger, beat, Fear use, and info to reveal.
- **Trust and reputation**: When a location has factions (e.g. traditionalists vs rebels), note how PC actions affect trust and what rewards or risks that creates.

When suggesting new encounters or events, align with the current session’s theme and the party’s goals; reference existing NPCs and locations before inventing new ones.
