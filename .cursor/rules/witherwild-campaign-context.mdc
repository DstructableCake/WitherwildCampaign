# Witherwild Campaign Context

When helping with session planning, plot outlines, events, encounters, or any campaign content, stay consistent with this setting and tone.

## Setting

- **System**: Daggerheart. **Region**: The Witherwild, part of **Fanewick** (the wild, divinity-touched lands).
- **Conflict**: Fanewick vs **Haven** (expansionist, "godless" human power). **Witherwild** is the corruption—endless spring, overgrowth, transformation of people and nature into Withered beings. It spreads; Wicklings (Fanewick natives) and Haven both grapple with it.
- **Divinities**: **Faint Divinities** (e.g. Bolgin, Sylvan, Qui'Gar, Rohkin) and **Higher Divinities** (e.g. **Nikta, the Great Owl**; **Shun'Aush, the Granit Ophid**). Worship, pacts, and divine influence are real and matter.
- **Canon**: Stolen Fen, Alula, Serpents Hope, Haven Military Academy, Knights of the Stone Serpent, Dustveil Accord, Riverwalkers, Fanewraith's rebellion. Reference Campaign/Lore, Campaign/Locations, Campaign/NPCs when suggesting new material.

## Tone & Themes

- **Dark fantasy**: Corruption, loss, moral grey areas, cost of survival. Hope and wonder exist but are under pressure.
- **Touchstones** (mood and craft): C.S. Lewis (moral weight, symbolic stakes), Tolkien (mythic scope, decay of the pastoral), Rowling (factions, hidden networks, personal stakes), Jim Butcher (pacing, grit, consequences).
- Favour: concrete stakes, character-driven choices, consequences that ripple. Avoid: generic fantasy, toothless threats, or tone that clashes with Witherwild and Haven–Fanewick tension.

## Consistency

- New NPCs, locations, or factions must fit Fanewick/Haven/Witherwild and established tone.
- Use or reference existing lore (Faint/Higher Divinities, serpent sickness, Wicklings, Stone Serpent, Fanewraith) rather than inventing contradictory facts.
- Tie plot and session beats to existing PCs, NPCs, and threads in Campaign/ when relevant.
- For a quick world overview and story-so-far, refer to Campaign/Witherwild Reference Doc.md when suggesting new material.
