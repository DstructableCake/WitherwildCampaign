# Campaign Wiki Conventions

When creating or editing campaign notes (NPCs, PCs, Lore, Locations, Sessions), follow these conventions so links and structure stay consistent.

## Folder Structure

- **Campaign/Sessions/**: Session N folders; each may contain Session N Prep.md, Idea.md, Area Reference.md, Scene Descriptions.md, and session recap docs.
- **Campaign/NPCs/**: One file per NPC; subfolders for **Higher Divinities**, **Faint Divinities** if used.
- **Campaign/PCs/**: One file per player character.
- **Campaign/Lore/**: World and faction lore (e.g. Knights of the Stone Serpent, Wicklings, Rite of the Turning Gaze).
- **Campaign/Locations/**: Places (settlements, regions, landmarks).
- **Campaign/Maps/**: Map references (e.g. DM vs player maps).

Organise new material into the appropriate folder; avoid dumping everything in a single file.

## Wikilinks

- Use **double brackets** for internal references: `[[Theodore Underbrush]]`, `[[Nikta, the Great Owl]]`, `[[Session 6 - The Seige of Serpents Hope]]`.
- Link to NPCs, PCs, locations, lore, and session docs by their note name (filename without .md).
- In session prep, link every named NPC, location, and lore element that appears so the GM can jump to the note.

## Obsidian Callouts

- **Read-aloud / quotes**: `> [!QUOTE] Title` for narration or in-world dialogue.
- **GM notes**: `> [!NOTE]` for optional beats, variants, or reminders.
- **Info blocks**: `> [!INFO]` for reference or non-secret context.
- **DM-only secrets**: Wrap in `%% ... %%` (Obsidian comment) or put under a callout titled "DM Only" or "Secret Goals".

## NPC / PC / Lore Doc Patterns

- **NPCs**: Overview, appearance, personality, location, faction alignment, what they know, interaction hooks, plot connection. In Area Reference docs, NPCs often include "Location" (e.g. Tree 2B), "Faction Alignment", "What They Know", "Plot Connection". Use a consistent header level for each.
- **PCs**: Player name, heritage/community/class, history, what they want, what they know, relations (with wikilinks). DM-only goals in `%%` or a collapsed callout.
- **Lore**: Overview, history, structure, key figures. Link to related NPCs, locations, and sessions.

When suggesting new NPCs or locations, add them under Campaign/NPCs or Campaign/Locations and link from the session or lore doc that introduces them. Prefer extending existing threads and recurring NPCs over one-off inventions for major beats.
