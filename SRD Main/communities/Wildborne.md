# WILDBORNE

Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest. Wildborne communities are defined by their dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among. This results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results. It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest canopy. It’s not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland homes.

*Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.*

## Witherwild 

Characters from these communities were likely raised in
[[Fanewick]]’s deadly environments, which have only become more
dangerous as the [[WitherWild]] grows. Each community has
unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret,
that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and
the Faint Divinities’ territories.

In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves
and their families, some [[Wicklings]] from these groups have
been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields.
Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation
destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the
Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.
