# WANDERBORNE

Being part of a wanderborne community means you’ve lived as a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide variety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a religion or a set of political or economic values, others come together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the choice to continue down that road together mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering loyalty.

*Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful, reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.*

## COMMUNITY FEATURE

***Nomadic Pack:*** Add a Nomadic Pack to your inventory. Once per session, you can spend a Hope to reach into this pack and pull out a mundane item that’s useful to your situation. Work with the GM to figure out what item you take out.

## Witherwild 

Wanderborne communities can be found in both [[Fanewick]] and
[[Haven]], though safe travel has been severely restricted due to
the military occupation and the expansion of the [[WitherWild]].
Whether a Wanderborne character comes from Fanewick,
Haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their
character’s personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and
how that aligns or departs from their community’s views.

- What do you do to keep your small community safe, independent, and hidden from Haven’s forces?
- Because of your community’s transience, you have loved ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected your relationship with the invasion? 
- Your community travels to protect something. What is it, and why does it keep you from settling down?
