# UNDERBORNE

Being part of an underborne community means you’re from a subterranean society. Many underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much deeper. These communities range in size from small groups in burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and skill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface.

*Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.*

## COMMUNITY FEATURE

***Low-Light Living:*** When you’re in an area with low light or heavy shadow, you have advantage on rolls to hide, investigate, or perceive details within that area.


## Witherwild 

Characters from these communities were likely raised in
[[Fanewick]]’s deadly environments, which have only become more
dangerous as the [[WitherWild]] grows. Each community has
unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret,
that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and
the Faint Divinities’ territories.

In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves
and their families, some [[Wicklings]] from these groups have
been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields.
Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation
destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the
Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.
