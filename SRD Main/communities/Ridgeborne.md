# RIDGEBORNE

Being part of a ridgeborne community means you’ve called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. Those who’ve lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they’ve thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground advantage.

*Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.*

## COMMUNITY FEATURE

***Steady:*** You have advantage on rolls to traverse dangerous cliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and use your survival knowledge.

## Witherwild 

Characters from these communities were likely raised in
[[Fanewick]]’s deadly environments, which have only become more
dangerous as the [[WitherWild]] grows. Each community has
unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret,
that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and
the Faint Divinities’ territories.

In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves
and their families, some [[Wicklings]] from these groups have
been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields.
Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation
destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the
Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.
