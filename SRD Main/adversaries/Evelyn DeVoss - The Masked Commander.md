## FEATURES

***Relentless (2) - Passive:*** The Masked Commander can be spotlighted up to two times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Stone Serpent Plate - Passive:*** When the Masked Commander takes damage, reduce it by 1d10. This represents her reinforced armor mixing Stone Serpent gear with wild-grown plates.

***Commander's Presence - Action:*** Mark a Stress to choose up to three allies within Far range. Until the end of the scene, they gain +1d4 to attack rolls and advantage on saves against fear. Allies affected by this feature deal +1d4 damage on their next successful attack.

***The Mask's Authority - Action:*** Mark a Stress to intimidate or command. All targets within Very Close range must make a Presence Reaction Roll. Targets who fail are Frightened until they clear at least 1 HP. Rebels and those who know her reputation have disadvantage on this save. While Frightened, targets cannot take actions that directly oppose the Masked Commander's orders.

***Thorn Wound - Passive:*** When the Masked Commander hits with her blade, thorns wrap around the wound. The target takes 1 ongoing piercing damage at the start of each turn (bypasses armor) until they succeed on a Strength save (DC 15) or receive healing. Multiple Thorn Wounds stack.

***Stone Serpent Training - Reaction:*** When an attack misses the Masked Commander, she may immediately make a melee attack against the attacker as a reaction. This represents her defensive training from the Stone Serpent order.

***Tactical Retreat - Reaction:*** When reduced below half HP, the Masked Commander may immediately move up to Far range and gain advantage on her next attack. She will not fight to the death alone—if reduced to 2 HP or less, she will attempt to escape unless cornered.

***The Wild's Judgment - Action:*** Countdown (Decreasing 6). When the Masked Commander is in the spotlight for the first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, she calls upon the Witherwild's power. All targets within Far range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 3d6+12 direct magic damage and gain the Withered condition (disadvantage on Strength rolls) until they clear at least 1 HP. Targets who succeed take half damage. For each target who fails, summon a Thorn Guard within Very Close range of the Masked Commander.

***Momentum - Reaction:*** When the Masked Commander makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
