## FEATURES

***Relentless (3) - Passive:*** Fanewraith can be spotlighted up to three times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Bramble Crown - Passive:*** Fanewraith's crown grants resistance to plant-based effects and poison. While wearing the crown, she can sense Witherwild corruption within Far range. Once per scene, when a PC within Very Close range fails a save, you may spend a Fear to inflict 1 Wither token on them (represents crown's corrupting whisper).

***Wither Crown - Action:*** Mark a Stress to summon entangling vines in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within Far range. All targets in the area must make an Agility Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d6+8 piercing damage (bypasses armor) and are Restrained until they clear at least 1 HP. Targets who fail also gain 1 Wither token. Targets who succeed take half damage and are not Restrained. In corrupted areas (like Fern's grove), this deals +1d6 damage.

***Insurgent Command - Action:*** Mark a Stress to grant up to three allies within Far range advantage on their next Stealth or attack roll. Allies affected by this feature can move up to Close range before taking their action. If targeting a PC ally, add a narrative whisper ("The shadows bloom for you").

***Thorned Ambush - Reaction:*** When Fanewraith moves unseen or emerges from shadows, she may make a melee attack with surprise. On hit, deal standard damage and the target must make a Fear Die roll. If used on a target with Haven connections (like Sabriel), she mocks their regrets ("Your stone blade withers").

***Weft Whisper - Action:*** Once per scene, spend a Fear to sense hidden foes or weaknesses within Far range. Reveal one PC secret or vulnerability (e.g., Gnirth's amnesia, Sabriel's regrets, Fern's grove corruption). This can trigger a minor weft vision for plot advancement, allowing Fanewraith to understand a PC's deepest fears or desires.

***The Wild Reclaims - Action:*** Countdown (Decreasing 8). When Fanewraith is in the spotlight for the first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, she channels the full power of the Witherwild. All targets within Far range must make an Instinct Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 3d8+15 direct magic damage and gain 2 Wither tokens. Targets who succeed take half damage and gain 1 Wither token. For each target who fails, the area around them (Very Close range) becomes corrupted terrain (difficult terrain, and creatures ending their turn there take 1d4 piercing damage). The corruption lasts until the end of the scene or until Fanewraith is defeated.

***Fade into Shadows - Reaction:*** When targeted by an attack, Fanewraith may spend a Fear to teleport up to Far range into shadow or cover. She gains advantage on her next attack and cannot be targeted until the start of her next turn unless a PC succeeds on an Instinct check (DC 16) to locate her.

***Momentum - Reaction:*** When Fanewraith makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.

***Vulnerable to Redemption - Passive:*** If a PC successfully appeals to Fanewraith's lost family or performs a meaningful act of mercy in her presence, she must make a Presence save (DC 16) or be unable to take hostile actions against that PC for the remainder of the scene. This represents her hidden vulnerability beneath the revolutionary mask.
