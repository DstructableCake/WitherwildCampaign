## Make the invasion Personal

Consider how Haven’s invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts
your character. Let these details inform what they want and
what they’re willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved
one to the Witherwild or the Serpent’s Sickness, and more
are dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict
caused your character to act in ways they aren’t proud of,
or transformed personal truths they once believed were
unshakable.

## Treat Death with Importance

Taking a life should not be done without consideration,
desperation, and consequences. As your character journeys,
they should remember those they’ve lost and those they’ve
slain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future.

## Embrace Vulnerability

Find your character’s humanity and showcase it whenever you
can. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as
they are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies
even if they close themself off to everyone else.

## Paint the Workd in Contrast

Subvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to
charm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the
natural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across
the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and
devastating homes and communities. Show the grim and
ordered life behind Haven’s walls, but also show the culture,
art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety.
Contrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with
the devotion of the [[Wicklings]] and [[Havenites]] fighting to save
their home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons,
and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold
dualities.

## Show Them True Danger

Though it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy
that can befall the characters. To illustrate what’s truly at
stake, use the PCs’ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them
what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends,
communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events
of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these
aspects of their past—when your players create and are
invested in their character’s backstory, they have something
to fight for.

## Offer Alternatives to Violence

By illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the
PCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For
example, showing compassion—rather than swordpoint—
to a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild.
Similarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldn’t
only be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both
could also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old
wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven
and Fanewick from within.

## Create Multidimensional Allies and Adversaries

No adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have
multidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should
be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go
undiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the
right thing, even if it’s for the wrong reason. Just because a
PC or NPC is from Haven doesn’t make them a villain, and,
conversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous.
Finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations
of the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer
interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense
of attachment to the world for the players.
