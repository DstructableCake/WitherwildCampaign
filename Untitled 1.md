## Implementation Steps

1. Add "Hierarchy & Governance" section with 5 council members detailed (Elder Corin replaces Voss)
2. Add "Stores, Buildings & Vendors" section with 24 locations using reference system (1A, 1B, etc.)

- Each location includes: description, what players can find, who to speak to, interactions
- Organized by 7 main areas (Great Trees/Regions)

3. Add "Key NPCs" section with 10+ NPCs (beyond existing ones)
4. Add "Guard & Policing System" section with rebel infiltration details
5. Add "Physical Structure & Navigation" section with reference system, routes, landmarks
6. Add "Sandbox Design" section explaining open exploration, multiple goals, non-linear progression
7. Detail "6D - Fanewraith's Hidden Base" as secret location in Shadowreach (Evelyn's location)
8. Create new NPC file: `Campaign/NPCs/Evelyn DeVoss.md` with full character profile
9. Integrate all elements with existing Session 9 plot points (Theodore, Brindle's child, execution)
10. Ensure all NPCs and locations tie into main story threads
11. Add "Area Descriptions" for each of the 7 main areas with atmosphere, navigation, key features

## Notes

- Maintain paranoia atmosphere - players shouldn't know who to trust
- Class system visible through physical location (upper = wealthy, lower = poor)
- Rebel network should feel pervasive but hidden
- Physical structure should enable exploration and navigation challenges
- All elements should support Session 9's themes: execution, rescue, discovery, betrayal




Remove Elder Voss and replace with another name. She already shares similar name to other NPCs so avoid confusion.

Each location should have a reference to it so that it can me marked on the tabletop, similar to a D&D map system. Numbered, with alphabet sublocations as needed so as they explore the city, i can reference that area with some key information about it.

Would also like to expand on this with within each area of Alula you will have the store/ vendor/ building/ location, also needs to be companied by a description for the area, along with what the players can find there/ speak to, etc.

The idea behind Alula is that its an open area for the players to explore, they have a couple of goals that can be completed any any order and how they wish to attempt, so this should be a multi layered sandbox for them to explore.

In theShadowreach should also be the hidden area where the Fanewraith base should be. This should be a hidden secret only known to those close to her. Likely where Evelyn Devoss will be located should they wish to confont her.

Will need to create a character page for Evelyn also in the folder @NPCs
